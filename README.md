# letterboxd-sentimental-analysis

I have always considered myself a cinephile. Normally on the weekend, I will pick an intriguing film to enjoy with my friends as a weekly ritual. 
Although my friend and I all have similar film taste, we still spend an incredible amount of time in choosing the film that we ended up watching.

One of the ways that we determine if a film is watchable or not is by looking up its review from various sources. 
Movie reviews help users decide if the movie is worth their time. 
A summary of all reviews for a movie can also help users make this decision by not wasting their time reading all reviews.

As a result, I would love to utilize this opportunity to conduct a sentimental analysis on reviews of a series of films. 
After getting the sentiment score of all film reviews, 
I will then generalize characteristics of those sentiments to offer an abstract of positive/negative sentiments regarding a particular film.

Sentiment analysis can be very useful in various scenarios. 
It determines the attitude of critics depending on their reviews. 
Great Sentiment analysis of a movie review can rate how positive or negative a movie review is and hence the overall rating for a movie.
By evaluating the performance of different methodologies, 
I wish to offer a model that can accurately reflect film reviewersâ€™ sentiment 
and offer pertinent guidance for people who are struggling to find the right movie to watch.
