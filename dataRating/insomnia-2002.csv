0,★★★½,could never happen to dunkaccino
1,★★★½,"The MTV Movie Awards should have created a ""best tired as hell performance"" category just for Al Pacino"
2,★★★★,oh mr nolan how very david fincher of you!
3,★★★★,I am very impressed by both Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Both of these gentlemen give great performances in this entertaining thriller! I didn't know Robin Williams had a performance like this in him. I'm surprised I hadn't seen this Nolan film sooner.
4,★★★,"""Can't sleep...clown'll eat me."" -- Al Pacino"
5,★★★★,Ugh yessss I love it when men do dumb things
6,★★★,"wildly engaging, painfully predictable"
7,★★★★,*Fingers crossed I love Interstellar on rewatch as much as I loved it the first time.
8,★★★,Look for the next installment in Oeuvre-view: Christopher Nolan on Friday's Filmspotting.
9,★★★½,Honestly wish and hope Christopher Nolan makes another movie like this
10,★★★★,8/10
11,★★★½,"I fell asleep twice during ""Insomnia"", which is pretty funny when I think about it."
12,★★★★½,is a really smart and riveting psychological drama. Nolan's most underrated film that really keeps your attention and keeps you on your toes.
13,★★★½,7.8 / 10
14,★★★½,"And yes, Pacino is great in this, but man, Robin Williams just elevates this film to a whole different level. For someone whose presence in films has often made my heart warm, he *really* made my skin crawl here. Goes to show just how much versatility he had as an actor. Rest in peace, man. You rocked."
15,★★★½,Insomnia
16,★★★½,what no sleep does to a mf
17,Watched by,"much like al pacino, I spent this movie wishing I could go to sleep"
18,★★★★,". Or ""The Three I's"", as I call them. An unofficial trilogy of Pacino Prestige. Coincidentally, Nolan also has a ""Three I's"" trilogy. These guys and their rare-title-letter classics."
19,★★★½,"I struggle to fault this film, yet it still manages to give me Insomnia"
20,★★★,"Still good though, entertaining throughout, Pachino killed it as always, Hillary Swank was also really good."
21,★★★★,This happens when you don't give Al Pacino that thing what he wants for like 6 straight days!
22,★★★★,79%
23,★★★★,Yes it can. Great thriller that deserves more praise.
24,★★★★,E) Hilary Swank is that girl.
25,★★★★,"Probably thought of as Nolan's weakest film, this is still a cut above most other thrillers. The acting is superb. Pacino is really good here (though the scars from Jack and Jill still haven't healed) and Williams gives one of his finest dramatic performances."
26,★★★★,Honestly wish Nolan had to be a gun for hire on a couple more thrillers before getting thrown into the Batman mix. Just one or two.
27,★★★★,"""This guy, he crossed the line and he didn't even blink. You don't come back from that."""
28,★★★½,.
29,★★★★½,I really enjoyed this film. This isn't like Nolan's usual work but it's strong. I like his subtle approach. All the acting is top notch especially from Pacino & Williams. I loved when they shared the screen together. My favorite aspect from this film is the script. I loved loved loved the story. Very unique & I wish I thought of it myself. I think this is an underrated film from Nolan's filmography.
30,★★★½,"Definitely the least Nolan that Nolan has ever Nolaned; I dug it! Worth watching for Pacino & Williams alone, otherwise a fairly standard crime thriller with a psychological edge & focus on character that I appreciated, plus some twisty turny stuff that was unpredictable & kept me engaged. Editing has its moments but kinda sucked throughout, & the end felt a little too neatly wrapped up. Still quite good; tense, great use of location, & another entry in the unintentional ACAB canon, which is always welcome."
31,★★½,Doesn't really feel like a Christopher Nolan film and not in a good way. Feels like a movie you would passively watch on cable and feels twice as long as it actually is.
32,★★★,the whole way through i couldn't stop thinking about the scenery
33,★★★,"A well crafted psychological detective thriller, which is a remake of a Norwegian movie of the same name. The performances of Al Pacino, Robin Williams and their scenes with each other, is the major highlight of the movie. Set in Alaska, the locations are visually pleasing and amplified even more with its beautiful cinematography. Though the psychological aspect is brilliantly handled, the narrative tension never hits the high it promises. Watch it for its brilliant execution and performances."
34,★★★★,A brilliantly crafted movie and a riveting watch.
35,★★★½,"Christopher Nolan made the world believe that a Batman could exist, but he will never convince anybody that Al Pacino has real hair."
36,★★★½,Can you get on the phone and call Pacino immediately for your next venture? Can't believe this was Michael Corleone's last great performance and easily the best thing about it along with the cinematography of Wally Pfister.Robin Williams is okay but i expected more! Having said that i still prefer the original version for unexplainable reasons.
37,★★★★,The film's strongest feature is the heated interplay between Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
38,★★★★,"Damn, what a great film. Like just honest to god what a great film. I love the dimensions they truly dive into with all the characters"
39,★★★★,"Al Pacino comes out swinging with a variation on his usual character, a flawed yet layered cop from LA with a vaguely southern accent and a sleeping problem. A game of Cat and Cat with Robin Williams makes this crime thriller tremendously watchable. Also directed by Chris Nolan so you know it's going look perfect."
40,★★★★,www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR621wTW_Ow
41,★★★★½,"Insomnia is an intelligent, incredibly well-acted, and enthralling crime thriller featuring a truly chilling turn by the late great Robin Williams, beautiful cinematography, and excellent direction from Christopher Nolan."
42,★★★★,"I just love Christopher Nolan's movies, he is very good!"
43,★★★½,"al pacino already looks tired, imagine if he had insomnia."
44,★★★½,Ranking: Coronavirus Quarantine
45,★★★★½,"First time seeing this in years and what a travesty it's never been released on Blu-ray in the UK so I had to import. Some of the finest work of Al Pacino and Robin Williams career. Pacino plays the morally ambiguous cop whose mental and physical state are slipping very well, while Williams does the chilling serial killer to extremely disturbing effect. The location makes for an interesting change of scenery to these sorts of films, every is overly bright and gives it a unique atmosphere. One of Christopher Nolan's most underrated pieces of work in his rich filmography."
46,★★★½,robin williams was secretly the most versatile actor huh
47,★★★½,al pacino & robin williams are treat to watch in this.
48,★★★★,But what the fuck?
49,★★★★,Watched on HBOMax.
50,★★★★,Nolan doing Twin Peaks. Amazing soundtrack.
51,★★½,LOL they played real life FROGGER
52,★★★★,"Elevated by excellent performances from both Al Pacino (who isn't really trying here but continues to amaze) and Robin Williams in this dark tale revolving around an intense character study. Insomnia keeps its viewers wide awake with the psychological chills it utilizes to a compelling extent of compromises and grisly backdrops, as all other surrounding qualities serve as solid in this examined crime thriller that is invested within the inventive conscience."
53,★★½,put me to sleep three different times
54,★★★★,"so while i did enjoy it, i also wish it had been just a little bit more nolan."
55,★★★½,"Cops are dirty. But they have really good reasons, I promise."
56,★★★★,being real.
57,★★★★,76/100
58,★★,ironic because this film cured my insomnia!!!
59,★★★½,Great movie!
60,★★★,One of the rare instances where a film is considered to be underrated for all three of the main stars and the director also.
61,★★★★,"is a fantastically acted thriller, and there are some incredible moments, but I can't say it's one of my favorites. Maybe it's my fault for only sleeping 4 hours before watching this, but I found it a bit difficult to focus on it, especially at the beginning. It does pick up considerably, when Robin Williams is introduced, and it gets really exciting in the second half. It's great, but it's sadly one of my least favorite Nolan movies. I'll definitely rewatch it in a few months, though. 8/10"
62,★★,"Whoever was demanding that Nolan direct the next Bond film must really fancy a bloated, cold, sexless Bond film."
63,★★★★,do you actually thinks this deserves a 3.5 rating or do you need to grow up??
64,★★★½,The first 20 minutes of this had a very strong resemblance to the Twin Peaks pilot (one day I will finish that show) which was an unfortunate point for me to come to because I spent the rest of the runtime wondering what David Lynch's Inception would look like.
65,★★★★,Nolan Flicks Ranked
66,★★★,Nothing special. Fairly generic but finely made thriller. The three leads make it very watchable.
67,★★★★★,Christoper Nolan's magnum opus.
68,★★★★,"Maybe not my favorite Nolan but it's still really great. He manages to explore a lot of different themes in this movie like guilt, problems with integrity of law... It's maybe his most straightforward movie but he adds a certain mood with his detective with insomnia which works really well. Al Pacino and Robin Williams are the weirdest duo ever but their talent is unmatched, Pacino really looked tired. I wondered what if DDL got that role, he wouldn't sleep for months and would probably kill someone..."
69,★★★½,nolan ranked
70,★★★,"this movie gets better, his performance is outstanding and his scenes are really good - the rest of the film is also pretty good, but I didn't love or like it THAT much, sadly."
71,★★★★½,"Thanks to the great performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams, the beautiful cinematography and some absolutely thrilling sequences, Insomnia is a tense, suspenseful and completely unpredictable film with great direction from Christopher Nolan and a chilling atmosphere."
72,★★★★,"A cold and stark thriller that, for me, never gets old. I like it just as much now as I did when I was 14 and first saw it. Robin Williams is mesmerising."
73,★★★★½,I'm sleepy. Night night.
74,★★★,"As for the film, I loved the vibes, but you can never feel the weight of the crime that propels the narrative, and we so easily lose sight of the female victim."
75,★★★★,"Nothing particularly special, but a great thriller nonetheless. I was locked in the entire time. Pacino crushes it here."
76,★★★★½,This guy crossed the line and didn't even blink.
77,★★★½,A credible remake. But right now I'd say I still prefer the Norwegian Insomnia with Stellan Skarsgard.
78,★★★½,"Lo de haber matado a gente es broma, eh. La peli me ha dado un buen rato. Recordaba que duraba tres horas y no llega a dos."
79,★★,i haven't watched a nolan film for the first time since 2017 and since then this has been the only one i hadn't seen. so yay! finished a filmography! (TENET comes out next week here so until then anyway.) this didn't really do much for me. it's a normie movie about dirty cops and the setting is the most interesting thing about it because parts of the world where the sun never sets for part of the year inherently intrigue me. love to see al pacino SPRINT though! but yeah acab including hilary swank
80,★★★★½,86/100
81,★★★★,"A taught compelling thriller that shows Christopher Nolan can knock it out of the park, even with someone else's script."
82,★★★½,"Christopher Nolan, please go back to making R rated thrillers"
83,★★★★½,"The only real issue with this film was that editing. Other than that, I was pretty much engaged with what Christopher Nolan did here."
84,★★★★,"Between a gay cowboy as The Joker, a serial killer as Batman, and Mrs. Doubtfire as a murderer, it is impossible to judge Christopher Nolan's casting decisions. If Noah Centineo is the lead in his next movie, you bet your ass that it is the right choice."
85,Watched by,Not as good as The Last Boy Scout.
86,★★★,", but this is easily his worst film. That being said, it does offer an intriguing narrative, a small amount of Nolan flair, and an excellent atypical performance from Robin Williams. The oppresive tone is well constructed, and I really felt the protagonist's exhaustion throughout the film. I just wish that that tiredness and insomnia actually added more to the central plot and themes."
87,★★★½,"plays a villain, and he fucking nails it."
88,★★★½,"I am now officially a Christopher Nolan completionist. The contrarian part of myself wanted to walk off declaring his best movie, but in truth, it's just okay. It does raise my belief that Nolan is a far better director than a writer though, he brings a certain professionalism and competency behind the camera to this thriller that raises it a cut above. He should make more movies set in the pacific northwest, a region with a naturally cold and foggy atmosphere suits him well, I feel as if this is by far his best looking movie."
89,★★★★,"One of Christopher Nolan's worst movies, and it still is really good. Nolan is definitely one of my favorite directors. Insomnia is a well-crafted thriller filled with great characters and a good story. The acting is superb. Pacino is really good as the sleep deprived detective, and Robin Williams is pretty good too. It is a bit slow at times, and it has some plot holes (How did nobody find the bullet, but when Hilary Swank searched for it, she found it immediately?) That aside, Insomnia is a really good movie with amazing cinematography. Alaska is beautiful."
90,★★★½,Did anyone else see Pacino kiss the pole at 1:12:40 because wtf
91,★★★★,p.s. This guy just wanted to have some sleep and to have some weird-ass dreams within dreams whithin another dreams(((((
92,★★★★,Christopher Fincher
93,★★★,"Easily one of Nolan's weakest movies, but I still found it enjoyable. I found the story very compelling, the acting was very good, the score very well composed, and the direction and cinematography were both very appropriate. In my opinion, Robin William's existence in this movie was a bit distracting and was a little hard to take seriously. The quality of this movie suffers from several bad editing choices and a few too many goofy lines in the screenplay (""You're just a little prick in a leather jacket!""). Not an amazing movie, but overall pretty solid and very watchable - 6/10."
94,★★½,al pacino looks tired in everything so he was perfect for this role
95,★★★½,I miss poor Robin Williams
96,★★★,And the Oscar for most tired looking goes to Al Pacino.
97,★★★★★,An excellent crime drama.
98,★★★★½,RIP Robin Williams.
99,★★★,Forgot to log this
100,★★★,59/100
101,★★★★,"isn't good, I had a good time with it. It's always fun to think about the possibilities tho"
102,★★★★,"Unpredictable and unconventional in all the best ways possible. Al Pacino, Hillary Swank and Robin Williams are at the top of their game here while Christopher Nolan gives us yet another severely overlooked yet remarkably crafted and suspenseful gem."
103,★★★★,More people need to see this underrated Nolan film.
104,★★★,"Other than Robin Williams' portrayal of Walter Finch which is actually pretty genius casting, this is solely a competently made crime thriller. Nolan at his bare minimum."
105,★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
106,★★★★,Let me sleep ... just let me sleep
107,Rewatched by,"haven't seen the original yet but i saw this in the theater when it came out and remembered bits and pieces in a very nolanesque manner. which is interesting, given this felt like one of his more restrained pictures. the overlit twin peaks adjacent setting provides great context for a quality pacino post ""hoo-ah"" lead performance. hilary swank is great in her naive/conflicted role, and robin williams almost too good as a creepy sociopath"
108,★★★★,"is probably the most conventional film in Christopher Nolan's filmography, seeing as it's a remake, and yet it's still one of his most compelling. Marking his first foray into big budget filmmaking, Nolan expertly crafts a sharply cold and calculated film, that's bolstered by some late career best performances from a somnolent Al Pacino and a rather creepy Robin Williams."
109,★★,"'s only compelling aspect is its lead performances by pacino and williams. otherwise, it is a dull, overlong ""thriller"" devoid of thrills. i shouldn't have bothered with this one."
110,★★★★,"Obviously this movie is overshadowed by every other film in Christopher Nolan's filmography. But this is an excellent cat and mouse thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Nolan gets excellent performances from Al Pacino and Hilary Swank. But the most impressive comes from Robin Williams playing against type. He is amazing in this. I still haven't seen the original Norwegian version of this, which I have heard is superior. But this one is really underrated. I hope Nolan goes back to making gritty R-rated films like this and Memento one day. I doubt that will happen though."
111,★★★★,"Widely considered Christopher Nolan's weakest film, I believe it is severely underrated and flawless. The film is tense and taut. Somehow makes you feel as if you were suffering from insomnia just like Al Pacino's character. Al Pacino, Robin Williams and Hilary Swank are all excellent in this."
112,★★★,"Insomnia is a solid thriller, but there's not much more to it. Pacino leads the film well and Williams delivers a fantastic supporting performance that makes the entire film worth watching. Nolan directs as well as he usually does, and the script is compelling enough. That's its central issue though; it's just ""enough."" It really doesn't stick out from the crowd, and at points, the glacial pacing gets to be a tad annoying. Insomnia is a worthy beginning to Nolan's studio filmmaking, but, with the exception of Williams' performance, is mostly forgettable and sadly close to be a cure for its titular affliction."
113,★★★½,"A taut and morally twisted mystery thriller with all the signature stamps of Nolan, Insomnia is a strong lead poison. A poison that grows upon you with multiple inhales."
114,★★★★½,"I'm a massive Christopher Nolan fan having seen all his movies bar Following as of typing this and Insomnia is probably the closest to a police procedural on CBS (where his bother, Jonathan Nolan is doing the excellent Person of Interest)/NBC that he's done - because essentially it is one, only with Al Pacino and Robin WIlliams, who put in some fantastic acting here. The cinematography is excellent and the atmosphere is superb, with some great, haunting visuals and an excellent setting. Hillary Swank is able to hold her own against Pacino and Williams as well, with the excellent cast really helping this movie shine."
115,★★★½,"This is either one of the best 3.5 star films, or one of the worst 4 star films. This was a very unique and interesting type of Crime/Drama film. Al Pacino and Robin Williams were excellent. Although this is Nolan's worst film so far, it's still very good."
116,★★★★,"While it is Nolan's weakest, it still pulls out some great performances from Williams and Pacino. It has a more of straight forward plot than his other work but Nolan makes it a lot more effective than other thrillers out there. The gloomy lonely cinematography is prominently shown to a great effect in actually making you slightly tired."
117,★★★½,Slow burn but very rewarding as it progresses. This is definitely gonna grow on me the more times I watch it.
118,★★★,david fincher but boring
119,★★★★½,The ending was good.
120,★★★½,Nolan is a strong director and this is a great effort from him. It's the story that brings this one down because it doesn't feel super tight. But the performances of Pacino and Williams are fantastic.
121,★★★½,everyone say thank you christopher nolan for giving us al pacino and robin williams together in a movie
122,★★½,. If anything it made me less hyped.
123,★★★½,3.5/5
124,★★★½,detective dunkaccino is on the case
125,★★★½,Obviously it's a Nolan picture because the characters act in the name of justice.
126,★★★,must a movie be good? is al pacino verbally abusing high school kids in dumpsters until they cry not enough??
127,★★★,"This remains a pretty bollocks film, like every Nolan I've seen..."
128,★★★★,8/10
129,★★★,One thing I stayed for is the evolution of the window covering- it becomes less organized and more and more desperate with each night. And I love unhinged protagonists.
130,★★½,"I know I can pick up some enemies around here by my opinion, but again I came across a Nolan movie that made me sleepy."
131,★★★½,You should check out the Calm app it has Cillian Murphy
132,★★★½,", I really do, but making a film without a giant plot hole just isn't an option for him, is it?"
133,★★★½,i'd have sworn to you that david fincher directed this
134,★,get worse.
135,★★★★★,This movie is just another proof that Nolan should be swimming in Oscars like Scrooge McDuck in money. One of a kind filmmaker.
136,★★★★,Robin Williams as a bad guy was not something I was expecting.
137,★★★½,"It might not have felt so at the time, but formally this is pure Nolan, particularly the investment in cross-cutting and the frenetic flash frame construction of some of the action. Pacino's in good form here, particularly in terms of selling the physicality of Dormer's extreme exhaustion. Solid movie."
138,★★★½,"Went into this not expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised by it. Great plot, great performances, and very good editing. The only thing that keeps it from being great to me is the weak third act because it felt like they didn't know what to do. I was hoping for something psychological, but it instead was a basic shootout. Definitely worth a watch and better than most people say."
139,★★★½,Gets a bit convoluted but somehow remains a fairly tight thriller. The last good performance Pacino has put on film? Hopefully the next Scorsese will remedy that.
140,★★★½,"is a well acted, beautifully shot film that exudes a dark, brooding atmosphere. Robin Williams was surprisingly fantastic as the deranged villain, and Pacino was excellent as well (as he usually is). Nolan's direction was mostly solid, though this is certainly one of his weaker films."
141,★★★★½,"Have not seen this since it was originally in the theaters and I like it now even more. Best part about it is how Pacino & William's characters keep one-upping each other trying to get dominant control of the situation. The acting, cinematography, and score are superb."
142,★★★★,Amazing. I'm glad the real account of catching Alaskan murderer Dimitri Keogh has finally been documented on film.
143,★★★½,(I know Jonathan Nolan is from Chicago. The joke works better if he has a British accent. Fuck you.)
144,★★★★★,"Believe it or not, people refer to this as Nolan's worst film. That's honestly horseshit. If you haven't seen this because of those rumors, or for any reason, do yourself a favor and watch this underrated masterpiece."
145,★★★,6.3/10
146,★★★½,"I avoided this one for a long time because I thought it was an adaptation to the Stephen King novel of the same title. (Wasn't a fan of that book, if you couldn't guess.) This was actually very enjoyable. Robin Williams knocks his role out of the park, and Pacino isn't bad either. I wish Williams and Pacino had been on screen together more, though."
147,★★★★,"when someone knows everything about the other, is it a must to say ""ugh, you did your homework""?"
148,★★★★½,Eye bags on fleek
149,★★★★,Al Pacino has one of the best sleepy expressions ever in this.
150,★★★½,Christopher Nolan Films Ranked
151,★★★★,#RW
152,★★★★½,"It looks stunning and the story is excellent, I really enjoyed this."
153,★★★½,"Good but not my favourite Nolan by a long shot. I think you could have even justified another 10-15 to give Swank a bit more of a role than she had but Pacino and Williams have good chemistry, surprising not so cerebral from Nolan (well nothing is compared to memento really) but still an interesting piece."
154,★★★,"This doesn't feel like any other Nolan movie. It's hard to tell if he had the choice of the cast, score, or source material. Al Pacino does play wonked out insomniac well, even if the character of ""Al Pacino, actor"" hangs too heavy on the movie. The story plays out well enough, but it doesn't cut like every other Nolan movie does. This feels like a Kubrick to Spartacus movie, a studio project where the director is an afterthought to the point their voice is taken out of the movie. That might not have been the case, I don't know, but that's how it certainly seems."
155,★★★½,fatpie42.livejournal.com/266588.html
156,★★★★,"The story was different enough to be interesting but nothing super original or exciting. Still, it wasn't boring and it is worth a watch, especially if you want to see Williams in an unusual role."
157,★★★,"was enjoyable enough, however I was expecting more from this particular director who a vast majority of people adore so much. I thought the plot could have been stronger, it wasn't particularly suspenseful at any point and perhaps the screenplay was a little lazy. Liked the performances, but quite possibly a film I'll forget about by tomorrow."
158,★★★½,"Not Nolan's best but still a good not great psychological drama. Al Pacino gives a great performance as the L.A.P.D legendary cop with mental issues of guilt with Insomnia. Hilary Swank is great as the rookie Alaska detective. Robin Williams who doesn't appear on-screen until an hour into the film, he's excellent. Insomnia starts off very slow first 30 minutes which is the reason why I didn't give this a higher rating but once it's settles in the last hour & 20 minutes of the film, it's good."
159,★★★★,"Holy, Robin Williams had range! What a sad loss."
160,★★★½,Al Pacino really sucks at frogger
161,★★★½,The level of exhaustion Al Pacino wears on his face here....honestly goals
162,★★★★★,No one is innocent
163,★★★★,Director Christopher Nolan's post-Memento paycheck gig - and least distinctive film - outshines the Norweigan original thanks to taut writing by Hillary Seitz and underrated performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
164,★★★★,solid. good one chris.
165,★★★½,he has become that fucking owl.
166,★★★,"not my favorite thing Christopher Nolan has ever done but it makes for an entertaining mystery thriller, especially because of Al Pacino and Robin Williams."
167,★★★★,P.S.- Al Pacino should have had dark circles around his eyes by the end of the movie. Just saying.
168,★★★½,it is absolutely bonkers to watch someone as beloved as robin williams play a role that was clearly written for kevin spacey
169,★★★★,Good movie severely underrated tbh. Love Pacino and Williams dynamic is good and the premise has a unique spin it was good but not perfect. Pacing was the main issue
170,★★★★,.
171,★★½,"Insomnia has some great scenery and performances but man I couldn't get into this as much as I wanted to. The script just felt painfully generic and Nolan's direction was just kinda there I guess? I haven't seen the original film this is based on but this definitely screamed ""weaker american adaptation"" to me."
172,★★★½,"A better-than-average psychological thriller, and perhaps Nolan's most straightforward film in terms of narrative structure and chronology. Alaska-as-Purgatory works really well, with the eerie fog, dark waters, and unyielding midnight sun. A tale of a guilty L.A. cop having his hidden sins exposed has a particular resonance in our present times. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
173,★★★,robin williams and al pacino were robins williams and al pacino. this was underwhelming
174,★★★½,"The last movie I needed to watch to complete my Nolan rank. Oh my god I was not expecting Robin Williams to be that convincing as a bad dude. His lack of screen time, mannerisms, and the way he talked, I was just like damn! I am scared of this guy. The least 'Nolan' of his movies I think. But that can sometimes be a compliment. He is so hit and miss for me, moreso than probably any other director. But this a good one tho."
175,★★★★,"It shows that the border between good and bad is more complicated that it sounds . It's psychological , intense and dark . Al Pacino and Robin Williams had fantastic performances ."
176,★★★,I wish Robin Williams had played more psychos.
177,★★★½,"is a very polished and intriguing thriller filled with twists, with great seasoned actors as protagonists, featuring beautiful tense cinematography and successfully utilizing the setting of Alaska effectively."
178,★★★½,Great acting - decent plot - odd editing choices at times.
179,★★★★,"solid script, but a masterclass in editing."
180,★★★,", but still manages to be a mostly engaging crime thriller that features solid performances from Pacino and Williams."
181,★★★½,"I forgot this was directed by Christopher Nolan, it just felt like a mix of The Snowman and Hangman."
182,★★★★½,A showcase of the insane talent of Robin Williams and Al Pacino in a near-perfect thriller with a somewhat predictable and conventional final act.
183,★★★★,Probably Nolan's least ambitious out of his filmography. But still Insomnia is an effective enough psychological thriller that's well-shot and features stellar performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
184,★★★½,Nolans least rewatchable film... And probably his worst. It's still pretty good. Probably a 4 star movie but watching it again adds nothing so just don't rewatch it.
185,★★★★,not much of a visual sense though
186,★★★★,.
187,★★★★,it didn't feel like a nolan film but i still really enjoyed it
188,★★★★,"While it may not be the deepest or most thought provoking psychological thriller, ""Insomnia"" ultimately works as well as it does due to the terrific performances of the cast. Al Pacino and Hilary Swank are terrific as usual but it's Robin Williams who steals the show as the menacing and creepy antagonist. Christopher Nolan direction is strong and has certain sequences that will surely have you gripping the edge of your seat. A rather underrated crime thriller."
189,★★★½,"Coyly subverts cop-drama expectations and turns the typical cat-and-mouse game on its head, although the final act still needlessly succumbs to unwanted action tropes."
190,★★★½,"Though Nolan's mystery drama is a well-crafted work of film driven by an outstanding Al Pacino, the story is far too straightforward for both my taste in murder mysteries and my expectations of Christopher Nolan. Nonetheless, I will not attempt to deny what this film does get right, which is a few solid performances, an interesting story that is capable of making you feel as though you have secrets to hide, and solid direction as always from one of the best directors around. It's an entertaining and well-written drama, but if you're a fan of Nolan's mind-blowing twists, you won't be quite as satisfied."
191,★★★★½,Who has Two Thumbs and Loves Blowjobs?
192,★★½,"Christopher Nolan is the consummate plain yogurt director. ""Insomnia"" is a pulpy haze of webbed shadows, but the safety net is always present. Al Pacino is the gruff, dogged cop with weathered eyes and a dodgy temperament. Physically, he is present, but otherwise the actor looks to be spiritually someplace else. And nothing is more upsetting than Hilary Swank playing a version of Amanda Peet."
193,★★★★,Now just let me get some sleep..
194,★★★½,Gunda
195,★★★½,Christopher Nolan Ranked
196,★★★½,"Definitely worth the watch for Robin William's performance. It is not bad for one of Nolan's early works, but I don't see myself rewatching it."
197,★★★★½,Nolan is a genius
198,★★½,This is just an another average thriller but watchable for the subtle performances of Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
199,★★★★,Gosh Williams is outstanding in this film. I judged Pacino for too long he is always so good
200,★★★½,dunkaccino!
201,★★,"Like he strikes me as someone that wouldn't laugh if he saw someone fall on ice but if there was a killer pun about cinema with a great punchline, he would do a light chuckle then find himself one day remembering it while brushing his teeth in front of the mirror"
202,★★★★,"Robin Williams could've killed a dozen people right in front of me and still convinced me it didn't happen with the power of his kind, soothing voice."
203,★★★½,When they're running across those logs it's like Frogger and Robin Williams is a GAMER.
204,★★★,For as original and mind-bending a lot of Christopher Nolan's movies are...this surely feels a lot like Se7en (by David Fincher)? Does anyone else agree with me in that this just feels so similar to that?
205,★★½,so boring bruh oh my god come on chris wtaf bro
206,★★★½,"Solid crime thriller, doesn't reinvent the wheel but is held together by strong performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams. Could tell Nolan didn't write this, but that's not necessarily bad"
207,★★★★,Also quite the irony of watching this when TENET got delayed again lol.
208,★★★★½,UNDERRATED
209,★★★★,"TENET hype got me to finally watch this early Christopher Nolan film, and man I have no idea why I waited this long to watch this film! Pacino and Williams' dialogues were perfectly written and this script was way more than a standard cop mystery. Still, somehow thinking of more recent Nolan films I thought of a twist that was going to happen but then it didn't, but when the credits rolled I was nevertheless wholly impressed."
210,★★★½,"Not Nolan's best movie but still great with good story, unique setting and solid performances by all the cast."
211,★★,please why is this so boring..........
212,★★★★½,"I'm not ready to give this 5 stars but that doesn't change the fact that this movie is fantastic! It's comlex, it's layered and it's very well written. Great performances and of course the directing from Nolan is incredible. This just further proves my opinion that he is the best director of all time."
213,★★★★,"P.S. Now with this and the short ""Doodlbug"" I've now seen all of Christopher Nolan's films to date."
214,★★★½,7/10
215,★★★½,"Yeah, that ending sequence sure is worse than the rest of the film. Though the rest is really good, so it don't necessarily have to say so much about the ending. But it kind of does anyway."
216,★★★★,R.I.P Robin Williams. HUGE loss
217,★★★★½,#Insomnia
218,★★★½,"One of Nolan's stronger films, IMO. He doesn't try to do too much and creates a beautiful recreation of a story with a parallelism between guilt and insomnia...hehe"
219,★★★½,Solid movie with an incredible performance from both Al Pacino and robin Williams.
220,★★★,"Kind of underwhelming considering the cast and crew. The fact that Nolan made this between Memento and Batman Begins, a completely unique take on the psychological thriller and then a completely unique take on a superhero movie, makes Insomnia even less impressive. Insomnia is a good thriller, but I just don't think it's as great as one would expect."
221,★★★,Solid Nolan film.
222,★★★,A murder mystery that has zero mystery and tension. The sleepy small town atmosphere is nice and makes it feel a bit different from the other Nolan movies.
223,★★★½,B+
224,★★★½,"A super underrated film. Tough to compete with most of Mr Nolan's ouevre but it isn't his worst film as some would have you believe. There's plenty to like about it. This review really seems to be damning with faint praise but I think it's a very solid thriller with excellent performances and an intriguing premise. I'll get around to the original eventually, I'm sure."
225,★★★½,Decent 7
226,★★★½,"A different outing from Christopher Nolan, abs a very effective remake. The ensemble cast is terrific but obviously Al Pacino and Robin Williams are the standouts. Delivering tense and layered performances that elevate the already strong script. Couple that with the unique location of Alaska during its endless summer Period and you have a recipe for success."
227,★★★★½,What a great performance by both Al Pacino and Robin Williams. And of course the most underrated movie by Christopher Nolan.
228,★★★½,"Insomnia isn't anything particularly novel or special, but Nolan uses the sleeplessness of Pacino's character to his advantage, creating a gradual loss of control as the film progresses, and using light to create suspense, instead of darkness, which is always very cool."
229,★★★★,"Alaska looks beautiful, what a great setting for any movie. You get Williams, Pacino, and Swank. Oh and Pacino is slowly losing his mind, great performance."
230,★★★★★,"Like Seven, but under a microscope, and ten floodlights for good measure. Beautiful, lite-brite neo noir. And some damn fine acting to boot."
231,★★½,this film gave me insomnia due to how boring it was
232,★★★½,he's so sleepy!
233,★★★½,boxd.it/5hKTQ
234,★★½,"So desperately wants to be a Fincher movie, but fails in just about every department"
235,★★½,i love you chris nolan but what was this
236,★★★★,Insomnia and Memento >>>> Inception and Tenet
237,★★★,"(2008), with Christian Bale and Heath Ledger dueling each other."
238,★★★★,Loved it once again.
239,★★★,Christine Nolan Ranked
240,Watched by,A crime thriller starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams directed by Nolan was always going to be great.
241,★★★½,Low key totally bonkers Pacino performance.
242,★★★½,"This is still just a solid watch. There's good ""unleashed detective"" stuff. The Pacino-Williams scenes don't disappoint. The chase scenes stand out. I think what impresses me the most is that the Robin Williams character is 2 steps ahead and 80000 IQ smarter. Really interesting stuff."
243,★★★½,Well... watching Good Will Hunting will never be the same
244,★★★★,"when that 18 year old hit on 62 year old al pacino,,,yeah"
245,★★★½,7/10
246,★★★½,"A well made thriller with great execution and direction (of course), filled with some excellent performances."
247,★★★½,of them all
248,★★★,"Al Pacino throwing a curve ball in this movie. Instead of giving us his usual crazy eyes, he gives us drowsy eyes."
249,★★★½,Robin Williams playing the creepy bad guy is such a rare occurrence but he does such a good job
250,★★★★½,Underrated Nolan film. Man was just tryna sleep
251,★★★½,"Far from Nolan's best, but still a good film in it's own right. Al Pacino and Robin Williams deliver some damn solid performances and are backed by some decent writing and an intriguing plot. I can't help but feel like parts and elements of this have been done better by other films, but this is not by any means a bad movie. It's not an essential Nolan film, but I enjoyed it."
252,★★★,"It's a regular cop-chases-a-killer story. As cliched as it sounds, I'll say it anyway, this, undoubtedly is Nolan's anomaly, probably the worst per his standards, yet notches above the mediocre noir films."
253,★★★★½,and sets Nolan on a journey to be a phenomenal filmmaker.
254,★★★,"Everything about Robin Williams' character elevates this film, but unfortunately be doesn't really come in until at least an hour into the film. As far as English-language remakes go, it's not terrible."
255,★★,I was waiting for Al Pacino to whisper ''Insomnia'' at the end of the movie.
256,★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
257,★★★★,"Intense script, enjoyable watch, cat and mouse chasing the killier of a girl in some very pretty Alaskan location. Who will survive? Could watch again."
258,Rewatched by,"Without sleep, consciousness becomes a walking dream laced with guilt. And maybe it's impossible to walk through grime without being covered in it, but the suggestion that actions taken with purity by a younger generation can actually lead to a positive future is such a pleasant one."
259,★★★½,"Also, what happened to Maura Tierney, and why isn't she in everything?"
260,★★★½,Al Pacino in this movie is like me when I take Ambien before work.
261,★★★★,One of Pacino's most memorable latter day performances. Shows that when he works with a top director that he can still be near to the top of his game.
262,★★★★,". Truly, the most standout aspect of this project is Robin Williams' performance as the serial killer, churning out a chillingly disturbing performance that overshadows Al Pacino tenfold."
263,★★★½,"Polished, adult commercial filmmaking, much more than the straightforward procedural I was expecting."
264,★★★,Robin Williams is the Gollum to Al Pacino's Smeagol. I'm only kind of joking.
265,★★,"This didn't feel like a Nolan movie. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't really good either in my opinion."
266,★★★★,"This gets better every time I see it, only Christopher Nolan could pull a performance this good out of an aging Al Pacino while Robin Williams is excellent."
267,★★★★½,Pacino and Williams (RIP) are what acting is all about.
268,★★★★,Pay close attention to Williams performance in this.
269,★★★½,"Surprising, gripping thriller, with good performances - one of Robin Williams's least-talked-about ones, unfortunately, but he's brilliantly creepy in it."
270,★★★½,"This was the last Nolan film left for me to see, and I really enjoyed it. Pacino is Pacino and Williams does a good job portraying the killer. Nolan's use of the camera and editing here adds to the thrill of the film, having us question every object and fact- thus achieving what a mystery/ psychological thriller should do. Shot in a beautiful location, and entertaining. 7.6/10"
271,★★★★★,"It's always good to start a Sunday with a piece of good film-making. Even though his body of work is still pretty limited, Chris Nolan remains one of those directors I hold dear to my heart. Always keen on hopping genres and experimenting... and always delivering."
272,★★★★,"Also, its nice to see Pacino actually in a good film this side of the millennium."
273,★★★,"The story was a bit predictable, especially the 3rd act. I really couldn't have told you this was directed by Nolan unless I was told before hand. Thoroughly ""meh"", and Swank actually might be a dude. Fact."
274,★★★★½,"Perhaps me giving this 4.5 is my film bro moment, but I don't care, I really fucking enjoyed this film!"
275,★★★★,seeing robin williams play a murderer was weird but intriguing
276,★★★½,nooo al pacino sleep deprivation is bad you must sleeeep
277,★★★,Nolan's least Nolan film. Al Pacino sleepy.
278,★★½,"This movie seems ordinary and trivial, I guess expectations do sell us short."
279,★★½,A decent thriller nothing great but worth a one time watch.
280,★★★½,im sorry Nolan...I can only suspend my disbelief so much...there is no way in hell that Robin Williams is successfully navigating over that log river
281,★★★★,What? The main character's wife is alive? NotMyNolan
282,★★★,This is a good movie.
283,★★★½,me tomorrow when my alarm goes off
284,★★★,one of the worst nolan's movies.
285,★★★★,at least now he can sleep!
286,★½,It's not Al anymore. It's Sleep.
287,★★★★,"of course, not what i was expecting from nolan but i quite enjoyed it. i've decided, i'd like chris to direct a horror movie."
288,★★★★,8/10
289,★★★,"An okay lil crime thriller. Al Pacino gives an unexpectedly spectacular performance, but just about everything else about this movie is pretty middling. What really holds it back, imo, are some of the most basic editing choices, both with regards to what should be extremely simple two-shot conversations between two characters, but also action sequences. It's downright frantic and very annoying- I felt myself almost getting a headache in the first half an hour."
290,★★★½,Jokes aside I thought it was a lot of cool buildup with a long and drawn out conclusion. Probably my favorite Robin Williams performance.
291,★★★★,That shitty mob movie actor must have been really excited to work with the grandmaster Nolan.
292,Watched by,Beautiful location!
293,★★★½,I like Nolan's timey-wimey stuff more but this is still intriguey-weegy! Also his name is Dormer! Spanish/Latin irony!
294,★★★½,Nothing about this film blows me away but that doesn't mean it's not a damn good movie.
295,★★★½,episode.
296,★★★,"I thought it had slight technical issues, but I liked it."
297,★★★½,"Pretty compelling concept and good acting, just felt like it didn't live up to its full potential. Still enjoyed it, though!"
298,★★½,This is just not it Nolan
299,★★★½,tried being david fincher and failed
300,★★½,pretty boring and confusing ngl
301,★★,.
302,★★★★½,the SENIOR CITIZENS are FIGHTING !
303,★★★½,Dark secrets hidden in hours of daylight. Pacino plays deliriously tired damn well.
304,★★★★,Twin Peaks
305,★★★★,-NOLAN
306,★★★★,"had forgotten how deliciously creepy robin william's performance is in this movie. what a guy, what an actor."
307,★★★★,go to bed
308,★★★,"It's not as memorable as Nolan's other films, so it may feel a little bland in comparison"
309,★★★½,It made me sleepy
310,★★★½,A pretty solid & underrated crime thriller.
311,★★★½,eventually.
312,★★★½,R.I.P LEGEND
313,★★★,"This movie is always entertaining and not entirely run-of-the-mill, but it also doesn't reach for anything really intriguing to me."
314,★★★★,Wow. This is a very good movie. The characters are good al Pacino's character is unbelievable! The entirety of this film is stressful and thrilling and I love it! Unfortunately the editing isnt great. And there were a couple characters I didnt love. Overall I honestly believe nolan is unable to make a bad movie
315,Rewatched by,The irony of this film is that I have never been able to stay awake through it.
316,★★★★,Happy 80th birthday to the legend himself.
317,★★★,I just kept waiting for the big reveal and it never came. THE REVEAL NEVER CAME.
318,★★★★,"It's a somewhat slow and straight forward Thriller, that only Nolan and co could elevate into something worthy of anyones time. Simple but elegant delivery."
319,★★½,Was not expecting this great of a performance from this era of Pacino's career but he knocks it out of the park.
320,★★★★½,the way that this film so nails the feeling of having to go about your day while your brain is screaming at you because you haven't slept hits way too close to home and feels like a personal attack and mr Nolan will be hearing from my attorney
321,★★★½,"Good remake. Hot take, but I prefer serious actor Robin Williams so much more than zany, comedic Williams."
322,★★★★,Love this film. Great performances all around. Pacino is so good. Williams is incredible. Swank is amazing. If you haven't seen it add it to your watchlist now and pretty please watch it soon!
323,★★★★,Pacino and Williams excel and their dynamic is compelling and unique.
324,★★★★,"STOP IGNORING THIS FILM'S PRESENCE, GOD."
325,★★★★½,"A fantastic thriller. Along the same lines as Prisoners and Silence of the Lambs. The pacing is not in a hurry, but captures you in a way only Nolan can. Gorgeously shot too with Wally Pfister behind the lens."
326,★★★,-
327,★★★½,sklept
328,★★★,"Though I found Insomnia insipid, I don't think it's a bad movie. It just didn't impress me."
329,Rewatched by,"Il film meno personale di Nolan, probabilmente un po' frenato dalla sua prima occasione ad alto livello, e da una star come Al Pacino che tende a mettersi i film in spalla e portarseli dove vuole lui. Tutt'altro che non riuscito comunque, anzi. Ma soprattutto mille punti stima per aver ingaggiato in ruoli minori, appena due anni dopo, entrambe le ragazzine protagoniste di Ginger Snaps: inequivocabile mossa da fanboy."
330,★★★★,"What a great thriller. I'm not sure how much the gimmick adds to it, but it is well-executed, nonetheless. Pacino is great, Swank is great, and Robin Williams is amazing. Lots of twists and turns, and a fun slow burn."
331,★½,this was boring as hell even tho i love the cast but anyway if al threatened me i would personally die
332,★★★½,"It's certainly not a bad film nor is it a great one. But, compared to Nolan's other work it's just a movie that doesn't seem to fit in with his otherwise outstanding work."
333,★★★,NOW THIS IS POD RACING!
334,★★★½,"This film is a bit of an outlier in Nolan's filmography. Small scale, very little action, very few twists, just a straight-forward murder mystery. Or is it? There's really not a lot to say about this movie, it's never really bad, but it's never great either. The titular insomnia is under-used, and that's a shame. It's a better than average crime movie, but it's not extraordinary."
335,★★★★½,What a fucking amazing film! This is by far one of Nolan's best movies and I put it in My Top 3 along with Interstellar and Memento! Wow. Robin Williams and Al Pacino have jaw dropping performances here. What a beautifully crafted film! This movie reminds about why Nolan is one of the best directors of our time.
336,★★★★,"""Insomnia"" is a dark, nuanced, and thought-provoking slow burn of a crime thriller from Christopher Nolan that features a smart and interesting story, brilliant sense of tone and place, and two great performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams."
337,★★★★,"Truly inspired casting, forcing restraint on two of the era's most renown scenery-feasters. We, the audience, know that primal wildness is in there, barely contained, desperate to explode. Nolan exploits that in such a genius manner."
338,★★★,:3
339,★★★½,This was better than I was expecting but I think it lost a little by watching it so soon after the original. It was interesting to see what little details they kept the exact same as the original when they changed some pretty big character moments.
340,★★★★,"I actually hadn't heard of this one from Nolan until I saw it expiring from Netflix. Anyway, it's a decent cop thriller. Hillary Swank is good, Al Pacino turns in a good performance. I always like Robin Williams in roles that kind of blur the lines between good and evil, and he makes a good villain here."
341,★★★★,"is still an investing crime film with a thoroughly intriguing plot, well developed characters, good tension, and two great performances from Al Pacino and the late Robin Williams. Christopher Nolan has yet to make a film I didn't like."
342,★★★★½,"Unfairly criticized for simply being a remake in the first place, Nolan makes all the right changes for a mass audience while still making a black and bleak modern noir with one of Pacino's better modern performances."
343,★★★½,"As much as I did like it, the film could have been significantly better. When you are watching it, it does seem like it could be a really dull, stretched out film and while it doesn't seem like much is going on, it manages to move along at a brisk pace and remains captivating."
344,★★★,"However, Pacino gives an incredible performance."
345,Watched by,"""You're about as mysterious to me as a blocked toilet is to a fucking plumber."""
346,★★★,"One of Nolan's weakest films, though nevertheless holds up nicely. Interesting and engrossing twists and turns amongst the plot, ordinary casting, only two or three satisfactory actors that forthrightly lunged the story forward to a reputable film. The incongruent settings contrasting against each were a strong central point for the film, credit to the production designer for that."
347,★★★★½,fantastic movie
348,★★★★★,"al pacino chewing gum to cure anxiety, THAT'S ME!!"
349,★★★½,GOOD
350,★★½,Had high expectations but pretty underwhelming.
351,★★★½,The editing wasn't goo tho
352,★★★★½,"A really solid film on all accounts. I've been giving a lot of 4.5s lately, but I'm proud to if they're all this solid."
353,★★★,"Dude could have just gotten some melatonin, would've been out in minutes."
354,★★★,"Nolan's worst is still pretty good. Pacino, Swank, and Robin Williams in a boiling pot of Nolan's mind bender stew."
355,Rewatched by,"I see movies much better than I used to. I used to think this was just a solid, patient little pot boiler. I see the playing with reality that's really going on here now. That's fun."
356,★★★★,two of the greatest actors to ever live plus the scenery make this a fantastic movie
357,★★★½,Nolan Ranking
358,★★★★,"As always, Rest In Peace Robin Williams."

361,★★★½,Gaslighting me about not sleeping for 7 days
362,★★½,"also this is my 100th first watch of the year :,)"
363,★★★,"Suspenful thriller. Look at director, cast, and executive producers. I enjoyed it. Al Pacino was great being Al Pacino. Beautiful backdrop for movie."
364,★★★½,This didn't feel like a Nolan film at all but it was still pretty good
365,★★★★½,It's so weird to see Robin Williams as a bad guy. I mean I'm so used to seeing him in stuff like Mrs. Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting. This shows that he is capable of quite a great range. I thought it was super cool how much they drew parallels between characters that were so different at their fundamental levels. I loved the discussion of how corruption is caused one tiny step at a time. And a discussion of whether or not the ends justify the means and whether or not there become a multiplicity of ends from one means. Incredible film.
366,★★★½,Production: American > Norwegian (American had more than 2000 times the budget though)
367,★★★,just buy a sleep mask Al
368,★★★,Midsommar
369,★,Made by and for idiots. Ashamed to have watched

371,★★★,That was very David Fincher.
372,★★★½,daylight noir <3
373,★★,Meh
374,★★★½,Robin Williams as a bad guy seems strange to me.
375,★★★★,"Robin Williams was about as natural a villain as anybody else, and now I need to cry for a bit after remembering his talents."
376,★★★★,"I loved this movie before, but now that I have been working overnights for more than two years, I truly understand how accurate the level of sleep deprivation is when facing difficulties with daylight sleeping only."
377,★★★,"Guy who has only seen Twin Peaks, watching his second mystery: Getting a lot of 'Twin Peaks' vibes from this..."
378,★★★★,"Everybody is Al Pacino saying "" let me sleep"" in the last scene every morning."
379,Watched by,The Smithsonian should do a whole exhibit of Pacino's leather jackets.
