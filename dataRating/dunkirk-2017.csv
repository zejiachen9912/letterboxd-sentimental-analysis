0,★★★★,hans zimmer: TICK TOCK MOTHERFUCKER
1,★★★,"so thank you, harry styles."
2,★★★,chris nolan: actually can I have 100 more of these dark-haired british twinks?
3,★★★★★,harry styles and the mysterious ticking noise
4,★★★★,its ok christopher you can admit you just wanted harry styles running around a beach with 3 other white teenagers to recreate your world war 2 fanfiction of the thats what makes you beautiful video
5,★★★,"i thought i got away with watching this on my laptop instead of imax but as soon as the credits started rolling, christopher nolan physically manifested in my room and started poking me in the left eye while yelling about the sanctity of the theatrical experience"
6,★★★★★,shook
7,★★★★½,Me: OH MY FUCKING GOD
8,★★★★½,wow! my favorite part was *incomprehensible british mumbling*
9,★★★★★,harry ate the FUCK out of that toast!!!!!
10,★★★★,i didn't understand a damn word these white men were saying half the time but you know what ! masterpiece!!
11,★★,"The first 20 minutes or so is the best thing Nolan has ever accomplished. The rest is a formal experiment I find so meaningless, dull and empty that I felt completely alienated from everything on the screen."
12,★★★★★,"3rd time seeing this, 3rd time wishing i was dead, 3rd time crying."
13,★★★½,"While it does feel like a movie I should like because everyone else likes it, I still really like it. AMAZINGLY shot and great performances all around. I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said about it."
14,★★★★½,i am incredibly surprised by my ability to spot harry styles in a crowd of white men
15,★★★★½,tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
16,★★★★½,"damn, great scene."
17,★★★★,The theatrical experience is officially DEAD.
18,★★★★★,"filmed in glorious 70mm, with 'dunkirk,' christopher nolan shows us distinctly just how tiny kenneth branagh's lips are"
19,★★,"After an hour and a half I was like, ""This is the longest trailer I've ever seen."""
20,★★★★½,the new three act.
21,★★★½,"((Plus the week really doesn't seem like a week, does it? More like two or three days. I'd suggest the structure is unnecessary were it not for Cillian Murphy's brief but superlatively disorienting appearance in ""The Mole.""))"
22,★★★★,harry was a bit of a prick wasn't he
23,Added by,I find it amusing that Nolan is so seemingly obsessed with time and yet does such a consistently poor job at depicting it.
24,★★★½,would love to understand one someday
25,★★★★★,click here to hear/see the gushing
26,★★★★½,"my dad only gave this four stars & when i asked him what caused that whole star subtraction he stared mistily into space for a minute before he said thoughtfully, ""the boats ... the boats were too clean. not enough shitboxes"" and ya know i can't fault him on that! your move chris"
27,★★★,imagine being a harry styles fan and being excited that your fave is gonna be in his first ever movie and it's a nolan movie at that and you go to the cinema after months of anticipation you buy your ticket and then it ends and you realize all your fave did was eat some bread
28,★★★½,.
29,★★★★,nolan knows that tom hardy's lips are the source of his power so ever since 2010 he's insisted on covering them up
30,★★★,fine lines
31,★★★★½,"I have mixed feelings about taking my WWII vet grandfather, who is in his 90s, to this. The visceral intensity was distressing for him, and he also was frustrated at having to watch a WWII movie about fleeing and failure. Of course this is also what I think makes the film brave and brilliant."
32,★★★★★,"in the middle my dad leaned in and asked me ""is that henry style"""
33,★★★★½,"(fucking amazing film, again)"
34,★★★★★,love the part where the beach twinks are hiding in the ship waiting for the tide to come in and then the ting go skrrra pap pap ka ka ka skibidi pap pap & a pu pu drrr boom SKIAA
35,★★★★½,"u know what im not even surprised my thirsty ass developed a crush on barry keoghan and his weird ass face, i sensed there was an underlying thirsty reason behind my sudden irrational desperate desire to watch dunkirk and when barry and his sleeveless gap sweater flashed on my laptop screen at 1pm on this fated thursday afternoon I Knew"
36,★★★★½,.
37,★★★★,"who knew nolan had something this stripped down and elemental in him? ""old bloke wouldn't even look us in the eye."""
38,★★★★,the sweaters in this are so on point it's kind of like a really intense J Crew ad
39,★★★★½,knows how to do is immerse you into his films giving you the full theater experience no matter where your watching it.
40,★½,", home is where the heart is. Maybe by the time Nolan makes his space western, the truth will set him free."
41,★★★½,"oh, whoa, whoa-oh"
42,★★★★★,"I honestly don't know what to say. Everything everybody said about this was right on the money. Gorgeous, grueling, tense, visceral, gut-wrenching, haunting, powerful, fucking loud. There's about 3 minutes of peace before the tension starts, and it does not let up at any point in the movie from then on. Every aspect of this movie was done so well, it's astounding. Absolutely see it in IMAX 70mm if you can."
43,★★★★½,: ...no
44,★★★★★,"I was going to make a joke about how pretty all those boys were but a film this good doesn't deserve that. This is incredible. Nolan's talent is unrivalled. I cannot put into words how good this was or how well it was made, just... wow"
45,★★★★½,the ideal way to see this is in IMAX but I almost went deaf just seeing it in regular theaters... Nolan trying to kill me... Also I can't believe it's 2017 and 1D is still getting my coins smh
46,★★★½,i watched this in imax while drinking a large tim hortons iced capp and i came VERY close to dying
47,½,"vain british chauvinism coupled with nolan's usual sweatshop approach to visual design. this is nothing more than an obtuse and literally deafening exercise in conservative revisionist history and bludgeoning the viewer into submission through sheer force of sound mixing. almost an immaterial narrative, there's nothing of emotional content here, it's a series of unremarkable vignettes that are all spectacularly boring in their own unique ways. nolan is the winston churchill of filmmaking: a stubborn fascist who's managed to bully his way into convincing people that he's a noble genius."
48,★★★★★,www.larsenonfilm.com/dunkirk
49,★★★★★,"i don't even know what to say, this is a masterpiece y'all.....christopher nolan did THAT"
50,★★★★★,"Checked this out at my local IMAX theater. It really might be Christopher Nolan's masterpiece, at least from a technical standpoint. And it's also the one film that feels the least Nolan-like. The Hans Zimmer score is intense as hell. And the dogfight scenes with the spitfire planes are absolutely exhilarating and breathtaking. It's a gorgeous looking war film that ranks as one of the best contemporary WW2 films along with Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line."
51,★★★★★,my heart was beating at 300 bpm for 100 minutes
52,★★★★,"were the casting requirements for everyone in this movie just ""have a good facial bone structure"""
53,★★★★½,Watched again because Harry Styles
54,★★★★★,"""No more questions Shivering Soldier"""
55,★★★★,"Telling the story from a numbers of different perspectives and yet not confusing are really astonishing. Nolan does an incredible job of making a war movie without any blood, we never see a German, and dialogue is at a minimum. Instead, cinematography and color are magical. Hans Zimmer's excellent soundtrack, creates a tense atmosphere where time feels like it's running out. Great cast. Also who would know Harry Styles could actually act. I wanted a little more of an emotional payoff, but this is a solid film and is well worth your time."
56,★★★★,I searched for quotes from this movie to use in this review but all that came up were lines of inaudible mumbling and whispering
57,★★★★,1d stans: heres how harry styles can still win best actor
58,★★★★★,"When a film gives you so many goosebumps and makes your heart beat so many times that you cannot keep count, you know you are in a ride for something masterfully intense. Great to see you back in action, Nolan."
59,★★★,Beautiful film.
60,Watched by,. Not a hater; not a fan.
61,★★★★★,me rolling off my bed and slamming onto the ground every time the soldiers leap off the sinking boats into the water: YOU JUMP I JUMP
62,★★★★½,christopher nolan said actually can i have 1000 more of those little brunette bitches
63,★★★★★,imax more like diemax amirite folks
64,★★★★,https://t.co/0KGMy1Dbtx
65,★★★★★,"Much, much more on this later."
66,Watched by,unprecedented to watch
67,★★★★½,is an amazing war film.
68,★★★★½,ohthatfilmblog.com/2017/07/24/dunkirk-2017/
69,★★★,"who's gonna tell christopher nolan that his serious war movie was a little less intense due to the fact that he cast a group of men that all look like harry styles, one of which is the actual harry styles."
70,★★★★½,"me, lying awake in bed in the middle of the night, on the verge of a panic attack: tick tock....................."
71,★★★★★,"Yours sincerely, the defender and protector of the shivering soldier."
72,★★★★,80
73,★★★½,"I get that they're British, but 80% of all civilian/nurse dialogue is basically: ""can I get you a cup of tea?"""
74,★★★★★,"I'd love to know why, of all people, Harry Styles was put in this movie. I'm not complaining, I'm just curious as to why."
75,★★★★★,Original review video here
76,★★★★★,Original review video here
77,★★★★★,Dunkirk is a masterpiece.
78,★★★★★,did hans zimmer ticking make me anxious or was i anxious before i started the film?
79,★★★★,A terrifying account of when soldiers are completely cut off from all avenues of escape and have no choice but to go in one direction.
80,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan really knows how to make an amazing film.
81,★★★★,harry styles i love your work
82,★★★★½,me whenever Farrier does anything: That's one hell of a pilot!
83,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan just made a Terrance Malick film and I loved every second of it.
84,★★★★,"christopher nolan's camera/cillian murphy's eyes. 100k. mutual pining, soulmates, friends to lovers"
85,★★★½,there are 40 thousand british twinks with jawlines and thick english mumbles that this shit just became a gay film! thank you daddy nolan !!
86,★★★★★,"A thunderous, awe-inspiring symphony of intense, visceral filmmaking, Dunkirk makes for an impeccably structured, terrifically acted, thoroughly engrossing experience that only Christopher Nolan could deliver."
87,★★★½,cillian murphy as the shivering soldier we love to see that
88,Rewatched by,is the definition of remaining unbothered
89,★★★★★,"GLIDE, PLANE BOY, GLIDE"
90,★★★★,so yeah this lives up to the hype! and harry styles is great in this who knew he could act?
91,★★★★,"I was pretty drunk watching this film, but it seemed dope."
92,★★★★★,I have lost faith in humanity
93,Watched by,me: exhales
94,★★★½,"If you're planning to see this, go see it in 70mm."
95,★★★,"i remember when this came out and a friend of mine was going to see it and i told him not to tell me any spoilers and then suddenly hours after the fact, i had realized i had fucked up"
96,★★★★★,5/5
97,Watched by,IMAX film at Universal City Walk
98,★★★★★,It's gonna win a BUNCH of awards.
99,★★★★½,This could easily end up being my most rewatched film of the year.
100,★★★★★,again i'm speechless. CN has done it again. i really can't say anything apart from this is the best war film i've ever seen and i've never experienced anxiety and tension in a film before like this.
101,★★★★½,for a dollar name a woman
102,★★½,I Wish I Was At Home Watching The Thin Red Line
103,★★★★★,is a god of making haunting and blood-curdling scores .
104,★★★½,"This is shot so well, wow. But that's about it. Still a great time!"
105,★★★★,"Little more than a mid-length experiment in cross-cutting as Hollywood blockbuster, and very fun to study just for that purpose."
106,★★★★★,"Dunkirk is a cinematically brilliant and a storytelling wonder. The actualization of the gritty aspecrs of war, along with the intense emotions gripping each soldier involved is one to behold. Those who are familiar with the history of the evacuation of the British army from the French beaches of Dunkirk in 1940 may have seen the past dry/unremarkable film and documentary versions recounting this event. The film is a complete 180 degree turn in both the visual and very intense soundtrack experience by Hans Zimmer. Overall, Christopher Nolan proves to us again of his versatility while still retaining his masterful touch."
107,★★★★★,perfect in every sense of the word !!! this film truly owns me and my weak heart ... wow i love feeling every emotion possible and being unable to breathe for 107 minutes !!!
108,★★★★★,Me (Wiping my tears) : I Know...
109,★★★★,I like the idea of a ship named Mimosa in a war
110,★★★★★,.
111,★★★★★,"Christopher Nolan, 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards, year of our Lord (Nolan himself) 2018."
112,★★★★,"While I wasn't completely blown away by the story, Dunkirk was still very affective in establishing its tone and transporting you into the war zone. The film wasn't completely memorable, but it had enough shocking images and tense conflicts to make Christopher Nolan's war epic a powerful experience."
113,★★★★,christopher nolan i watched this on my laptop please forgive me
114,★★★★,"y'all know that vine of that dude folding clothes and singing ""you better watch out you better watch out YOU BETTER WATCH OUT"" with more and more intensity? this is the 106 minute version of that. I feel like I just had 20 panic attacks in a row. thanks hans zimmer."
115,★★★★½,Chapeau for Christopher Nolan. Always a warranty.
116,★★★★,Stunningly visceral and masterfully crafted.
117,★★★★★,hans zimmer better be ready to pay for my gotdamn therapy sessions
118,★★★★,when harry styles wins his academy award...then you will see
119,★★★★★,That feel when you think you love a movie because it's about history and has non-linear story-telling but over time you realize it's more because of how it heavily relates to and relies on the need to care about and help other people even if you don't know them because with so much bad stuff happening in the world it's impossible to survive without the kindness of other people!!!!
120,★★★★½,"Also, I finally finished all the Best Picture Nominees of 2017!"
121,★★★★★,makes him tear up.
122,Watched by,"Good movie but damn tone it down, Hans."
123,Watched by,"i fell asleep and woke up and pointed to harry styles and some other guy and went ""THEY'RE BAD GUYS!"""
124,★★★★★,"Four dimensions: Height, Width, Depth, and Time. Four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water. One goal: Survival. The enemy has no face, but makes its intention known: Death. On one side, we are all driven by our individual impulses. On another, we show community and selflessness. Even though the nature of existence is constantly being threatened, hope still lingers. A miracle can save us, so just hang in there. Home is within your grasp."
125,★★★★,really wish I could understand people with British accents
126,★,"Hey, Nolan please stop making films."
127,★★★★½,"Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk, recreates the full story of the retreat. Rather than the usual eulogies of military and civilian unity against foreign enemies, he reveals the true relationship between war and everyone through three perspectives, one hour, one day and one week, in a panoramic interweaving of sea, land and air. It not only makes you see the history, but also brings you back to the beach of despair and death, and takes you through Dunkirk all over again."
128,★★★★½,THANKS CHRIS NOLAN AND HANS ZIMMER FOR MAKING ME HAVE 50 FUCKIN HEART ATTACKS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CINEMA... I FELT LIKE I PERSONALLY WAS ABOUT TO BE SHOT AT ANY MOMENT TALK ABOUT FUCKING VISCERAL...
129,★★★★½,I feel like going in knowing about the actual circumstances of the battle will help a lot with expectations though.
130,★★★★★,Let it overwhelm you.
131,★★★★★,"My words are limited, which make me wanna see it again, but Dunkirk is one of the greatest achievements in directing and editing ever to grace the silver screen. 20 years from now, it'll be shown in film school."
132,★★★★½,"2 hours of me asking myself ""is that one harry styles?"""
133,★★★★★,someone please reassure me that Tom Hardy makes it safely out of german imprisonment after the end of the movie thank you
134,★★★½,omg i can't believe harry styles fought in world war ii
135,★★★★★,THE BEST WAR MOVIE EVER!
136,★★★★★,"i love MY best picture winner (the shape of water deserved to win too tho, and i am SO happy for gdt)"
137,★★★★★,"still completely blows me away, and i love this cast so fucking much"
138,★★★½,Full Review
139,★★★★,I want Cillian Murphy to kill me next!
140,★★★★★,"my favourite character in this is collins, (the RAF pilot that isn't tom hardy) don't ask me why, i have no idea i just love him and i want a backstory"
141,★★★★★,I started crying as soon as he started reading the newspaper out loud wow I love happy endings
142,★★★★★,Nothing quite hits my emotions like when that engine cuts.
143,★★★½,Watched this in an imax theater where my buddy works. We weren't supposed to be there but he didn't get in trouble.
144,★★★★,Very good.
145,★★★½,hans zimmer SNAPPED with this score my bones were tingling with dread
146,★★★★,is a remarkable film.
147,★★★★½,"Nolan's most technically proficient film. So stressful yet so freeing by the end and imbued with so much reality, identity, and soul. That ending made me cry this time - it felt like home."
148,★★★★★,.
149,★★★★★,"- Jack Lowden as Collins, but also me every 10 seconds for 107 minutes."
150,★★★★★,"Christopher Nolan's WWII drama is suberbly crafted with moments of intense dread, its brillantly put together with some fantastic visual imagery and very little dialogue...another surprising aspect the film's length , in a age of bloated running times - this runs at under two hours which does'nt feel overstuffed or underserved...with a cast delivering unshowy performances (Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh & Cillian Murphy) Dunkirk just might be one of the years finest movies if not than probably one the most important."
151,★★★★½,WOW GUYS WOW
152,★★★★★,i would die for this film
153,★★★★★,anyway i love this movie a lot so it was worth it
154,★★★★,"No doubt the most gorgeous film of the year, even for a Nolan bottle episode. Dunkirk is tense and droning I'm surprised my butthole held up. So perfectly plotted I like to imagine those many sleepless nights Nolan must of spent in low light looking vaguely like a sweaty Quentin Tarantino, making flow charts. Is it in Tom Hardys contract to have his face covered up?"
155,★★★★½,at something than I have at this movie.
156,★★★★½,pretty bold choice on nolan's part to go ahead and invent the color blue like that
157,Watched by,ummm who are you and what have you done with Christopher Nolan i.e. the man who made a 169 minute long movie about matthew mcconaughey in space
158,★★★★½,Nolan at his absolute best. Breathtaking cinematography
159,★★★★½,... But then again...
160,★★★½,Netflix. vista desde mi celular de pantalla 5.5' y con auriculares. tal como Nolan hubiese querido que la vea.
161,★★★★★,"Not just a movie, a full experience"
162,★★★,"I have to say it, Harry Styles is a good actor"
163,★★★★★,me: *googles* how to donate eyeballs
164,★★,Probably my second least favourite cinema experience this year so far.
165,★★★★,chris nolan really made another fuckin movie where he hides tom hardys beautiful face turn on ur location u fuckin coward
166,★★★★½,"And so, with 'Sign of the Times' and now this, Harry Styles's redemption is complete. I'll write more about this later."
167,★★★★½,Can't wait until Warner Brothers submits the screenplay to the Academy and I can finally learn what they're saying.
168,★★★★★,"shook me to my core- when a few of those bombs got dropped on the beach in the opening scene, I could literally feel my chest vibrating from how loud the sound design was. And once it was all over, I basically felt like Cillian Murphy's character, completely shell-shocked. I'm still reeling from the whole thing."
169,★★★★,"lmao at that one extra who ruined what was supposed to be the best scene in the movie because he couldn't contain his excitement, a legend."
170,★★★★,"I liked it a lot - but can't say I loved it. That may change on the rewatch, I'm not sure. There's a lot to take in here and a lot of themes to ponder before I actually write a full review. So don't take what I'm saying now (or even the rating) as a permanent thing."
171,★★★★★,in IMAX 70mm film.
172,★★★★½,Can you even imagine how stressful it must have been to be an Academy voter in 2017 and having to pick between 6 or 7 modern classics for everything? As someone who cannot make a decision to save their life I would've simply passed away.
173,★★★★★,Masterpiece.
174,★★★★½,it's just such an intense experience. idk if it'd hold up watching it on a smaller screen or in hindsight but for now i like it.
175,★★★★½,I am hundred procent sure that Nolan got some inspiration from La Haine with his ticking sound.
176,★★★★½,of 2017 so far :)
177,★★★★½,holy shit.
178,★★★★★,this was my first experience with imax and wow Cillian Murphys eyes were even bluer
179,★★★★,i accidentally got drunk at dinner right before seeing this with my parents but you bet your ass i sobered up the second i saw Sir Harry Edward Styles making his big screen debut
180,★★★★½,is still bullshit
181,★★★★½,"me after seeing tom glynn-harney and jack lowden look like they do for an hour and a half: yeah, can I get 5 more of these little blond bitches?"
182,★★★★★,every time cillian murphy looks scared i level up
183,Rewatched by,"2. My dad thinks Tom Hardy is cool and so do I, baby!!!"
184,★★★★½,dear god i love a white man by the name of tom hardy
185,★★★★,lets play guess which is the main character or what his name is
186,★★★★,I've read many reviews claiming that this movie lacks character development but I think that Nolan was trying to show that soldiers are like robots... They just follow orders without questioning but I might be wrong.
187,★★★★★,"Como dice el comandante Bolton: ""For the French""."
188,Watched by,me after seeing dunkirk: war movies are slightly less bad and also they're bigger
189,★★★★★,This may very well win the coveted Best Picture award at next year's Oscars.
190,★★★★½,I didn't think that we'd get to the point in time where a Christopher Nolan film is UNDERRATED but here we are.
191,★★★★½,hans zimmer IS TOO GOOD AT HIS JOB
192,★★★★★,when this movie was released i thought harry styles was going to be terrible in this but he was really good. the soundtrack is fantastic by Hans zimmer. plus the imax shots are amazing looking on my 4k tv. but overall great war movie.
193,★★★★★,"Nolan's experimental amalgamation of his entire filmography: time, symbols, elements, duty, and the exhausted people caught in the flux of it all."
194,★★★★★,"Although the lack of a big screen and excellent sound system does decrease its impact, Dunkirk still stands as incredible filmmaking thanks to Nolan's strongest direction yet. The year's most technically strong film, and a riveting piece all around."
195,★★★★★,= 5/5
196,★★★★★,Incredible film. Superbly crafted and extremely moving.
197,★★★★★,i still don't know what to say. just stunning
198,★★,bit.ly/2w31Q7O
199,★★★★★,"christopher nolan, the only man to simultaneously make me cry tears of suffering and nut because of the amazing directing"
200,★★★½,2017 Films Ranked
201,★★★,Maybe i should watch this in the cinema?
202,★★★★★,"There's a scene in Lost in Translation where Bill Murray is acting out his whisky commercial and the director(through a translator) is telling him to do it with ""More intensity."" This is what the Fuck they were talking about Bill!!"
203,Watched by,"Also, 500 reviews is kinda cool!"
204,★★★★½,is it fucked up that this is one of my comfort movies
205,★★★★★,Near perfect viewing experience the 70MM is so beautiful the only downside was sometimes I'd stare at the top right corner of the screen looking for the cigarette burns.
206,★★★★★,i'm never going to get that fucking ticking sound out of my head. masterpiece. adios.
207,★★★★★,"A defining career moment for Christopher Nolan, and a high point for the art of filmmaking."
208,★★★★,cillian murphy and harry styles in one movie. i don't think you understand i'm obsessed
209,★★,"Good thing they survived, or else we wouldn't have One Direction."
210,★★★★★,"This movie was almost as effective on a tiny screen as it was in IMAX and that says something. So much better than I remembered and I remembered it as being amazing. If the ending doesn't make you emotional, I don't know what will."
211,★★★★,i was so confused bc all of those twinks looked the same!
212,★★★★★,www.cineenserio.com/dunkerque-christopher-nolan-arte-y-vida/amp/
213,★★★★½,"The narrative structure was a little tough to get used to, to the point that I'm just hoping I understood everything properly. The lack of backstory and exposition was a risk that could be polarizing depending on if everybody reads the situation and subtext the same. I felt super drawn into the plot and the immersive filmmaking helped a whole lot."
214,★★★★★,Only my second watch. I really should watch this more often.
215,★★★,sexy harry styles sexy tom hardy DILF KENNETH BRANAGH sexy cillian murphy
216,★★★★½,Quite the experience to revisit.

225,★★★★,After seeing both BR2049 and Dunkirk in one day I can confirm that Hans Zimmer is God
226,★★★★★,essentially a 107 minute long WW2 version of Potter Puppet Pals: The mysterious ticking noise
227,Rewatched by,DGA 1 in 70mm
228,★★★★,i am horny for this sound design
229,★★★★★,Dunkirk is not a film. It is an experience.
230,★★★★★,Watching this at midnight is my revenge against my neighbors for being loud in the morning
231,★★★★,trilogy
232,★★★★½,Harry Styles acting phew
233,★★★★★,?????? the acting??? the intensity???? christopher nolan deserves all of the awards holy shit. a true masterpiece.
234,★★★★½,probably a masterpiece.
235,★★★★★,anyway i cried the whole time
236,★★★,I stopped paying attention for a solid 10 minutes because I was just thinking about The Thin Red Line
237,★★★★½,why does cillian murphy always look like he's been in a room doing hard drugs for 10 years and then one day decided to become an actor
238,★★★★½,Probably the most insane theater experience I've ever had. (70MM IMAX)
239,★★★★½,JESUS CHRIST ON A BIKE
240,★★★★½,P.S. I have never been so frightened by the sound of an airplane before.
241,★★★★★,god I want to wrap a blanket around cillian murphy and then die so bad
242,★★★★,.
243,★★★★½,"Say what you will about digital projection, nothing compares to seeing a movie projected on film. This film MUST be seen in a theatre and preferably on film."
244,★★★★★,HAPPY 4 YEARS !!
245,★★★★★,Tom Hardy is amazing and should be in every movie. So is Cillian Murphy.
246,★★★★½,"You did it again, Chris!!"
247,★★★★½,Commander Bolton: Home.
248,★★★★,"All spectacle, all of the time. While it's definitely the most idiosyncratic and intimidating entry in the Nolan canon thus far in terms of subject matter, it does make for one hell of an intense, meditative, and poignant thrill ride. RIP George."
249,★★★★½,"Nolan why are you so good whyyyy? One of the best looking Nolan movies for sure, it's such a pleasure to watch plane scenes like true cinema right there. I really love how we don't know anything about our characters because that makes they feel equally important, their experience is what matters the most in that moment. This is how you make a real war movie!!!"
250,★★★★★,emotion. Nothing short of a masterpiece. Literally so close to making my top 4.
251,★★★★½,to be tom glynn carney on a boat with cillian murphy <3
252,★★★★★,"i saw this in imax when it came out in theaters and i was BLOWN AWAY. this film is seriously a masterpiece. the acting, the sound design, the editing back and forth between the stories, the cinematography.. i don't really know what i can say that could possibly do this film justice. ALSO harry styles, am i right? christopher nolan is probably a genius, huh?"
253,★★★★★,""""
254,★★½,"Other than that I was just mostly annoyed at the immensely irritating score. I know it is supposed to help with the building terror/anxiety, but it mostly just made me want to turn the film off in its entirety..."
255,★★★★,"cinema experience in the summer which I, unfortunately, couldn't partake in. Did that hinder the possibility of a higher rating? We'll never know."
256,★★★★★,"A phenomenal film about humanity's cruelty and compassion. Dunkirk is a film only Nolan could make, a story of hope that completes with a nightmarish ending. Utter terror is what the characters feel throughout all of Dunkirk, and by the end, the audience is tired. Tired of staring at the horrors portrayed, tired of hearing how terrible the sounds of gunfire are, and tired of war's inherent tragedy. Even without the IMAX format, this is what pure bravado cinema can be, something utterly thrilling to watch but even more distressing to think about afterwards. What a haunting work. What an extraordinary accomplishment."
257,★★★★,"I thought from the trailers that this was going to be Nolan's Heaven's Gate, but it's perversely and delightfully pared down to almost experimental proportions, an exercise in (literal, if you include the score, and how could you not?) clock-ticking tension that comes close to eschewing dialogue altogether. I have no idea if this approach is more authentic or historically accurate than conventional war narratives, but it does feel like a refreshing contrast anyway."
258,★★★★,Christopher Nolan Hates Tom Hardy's Face (Part 2 of 2)
259,★★★★,whats that noise its me shitting meself everytime a bullet hits the side of tom hardys metal plane
260,★★★★½,"also Christopher Nolan: I let Harry Styles from One Direction say ""fuck"" two times in my movie"
261,★★★★★,"None of the actors in this movie are going to win any awards, and that is a massive compliment. All of the pretension that comes with acting/performing is dynamited in this film, and we instead get extremely real feeling characters and very raw performances."
262,★★★,OK but did that poor boy ever get to take a shit?
263,★★★★★,"where the enemy is the shark - hardly seen other than fins and wings, the battlefield is the water, Cillian Murphy is Brody, Mark Rylance is Hooper and Tom Hardy is Quint, even succumbing to the antagonist like Quint in the end. And Zimmer is full-on Williams with the music, his most tense and release score, seemingly ratcheting your nerves and then unleashing all stress sometimes within the same montage. Love him or hate him for it, Nolan is the cross-cutting montage king."
264,★★★★★,See it on the biggest screen you can.
265,★½,Film is alive but cinema is dead.
266,★★★★,"Emotionally bland unless that emotion is stressful anticipation. But that's okay, in a movie like this I'm not looking to have my heart strings tug on (although the portion with Rylance does have some emotional heft), rather I'm looking for technical wizardry and design on a monumental scale, which it delivers with aplomb. Judged on what it is looking to accomplish, it's a near perfect war movie."
267,★★★★½,Us : nolan go slrrrp
268,★★★★★,"This is a masterpiece, I'm in love with the sound editing and the cinematography (those air scenes were nothing but perfect). Every single performance is great, even if no one had ""enough"" screentime, the moments they were given were fucking great. For a Nolan and a war film it feels way too short but either way it manages to be awesome. It's almost sad how satisfying yet upsetting that ending is, I can't stop thinking about it."
269,★★★★,"was a great film the first time I watched it, but this second viewing really made me love it."
270,★★★★★,but then I decided to rewatch this movie
271,★★★★½,"buttttttt thank you all for reading my reviews. It means a lot, to feel cared about. I wish you all the best of luck on the new year."
272,★★★★½,hacksaw ridge retire bitch
273,★★★★★,I had three (3) heart attacks
274,★★★★,Wow. NO EXPOSITION-FILLED DIALOGUE? Hooray!
275,★★★½,"A solid, unglamorous war movie. I guess that's all we can ask for these days."
276,★★★★★,"tom hardy, once again, the true hero"
277,★★★★,"No character development, minimal dialogue, thick accents, but somehow Christopher Nolan has still crafted an intense film about the tragic events of Dunkirk. That is due to Nolan's framing and camera work that brings out the most of his actors and environment. Also, Hans Zimmer has entered a new level of scoring. When a film score composer makes you clench your butthole from just a scene where a character walks around on the beach with his intense scoring. He fucking deserves another Oscar."
278,★★★★★,wow chrisopher nolan has done it again WHAT A MAN
279,★★★★★,is a masterful achievement in cinema that is remarkable in every way imaginable.
280,★★★★½,OH MY GOD
281,★★★★,Best sound effects of 2017.
282,★★★★★,also this was my second watch but you know a movie has got me stressed when i start cursing in french
283,★★,"Nolan auf Oscar-Bait Tour. Wenn er es braucht, bitte."
284,★★½,"Got as much out of DUNKIRK as a montage-heavy IMAX nature doc. The entire piece conveys a new near-experiemental energy for Christopher Nolan, but not a fully successful or multi-expressive one. Setting intercutting timelines patched together no better as depthless, but technically winded immersive montages. Yet this explicit sensational structure makes it far too difficult for viewers to latch onto anything. Equally despairing and admiring as a meticulously orchestrated simulation piece sweeping audiences into the unvarnished winds of chaos and uncertainty of war, but the less-realized characterization undermines the notions of stakes, emotion and tension."
285,★★★★,Phenomenal
286,Rewatched by,((but fr i love this movie))
287,★★★★,As ever it's great to see christopher nolan's skillful direction at work but I dont think it's his best film but still an exciting cinematic experience
288,★★★★½,Best Nolan movie imo
289,★★★★½,This is one of those movies that I have to watch again because purely of the breathtaking cinematography.
290,★★★★,There are no faces in war. Nolan reminds us in one of the most thrilling and Nolan ways possible.
291,★★★★★,"Worried it wouldn't translate as well at home but it remains every bit as compelling, compulsive and extraordinary viewing as it did on the big screen. Technically astonishing and emotionally resonant, Dunkirk is exemplary filmmaking with fires on every cylinder -- and Christopher Nolan's finest for my money."
292,★★★★,brilliant!
293,★★★★★,Tom Hardy could have defeated the Germans with his bare hands.
294,★★★★★,"Similar to how the British and French were surrounded by their enemy, I was surrounded by my own enemy; people who talk nonstop during movies."
295,★★★★★,i swear i can still hear that clock.
296,★★★★,Just a shame we'll have to wait another four or so years for another Nolan movie.
297,★★★★½,"speechless. absolutely incredible. nolan, you fucking did it"
298,★★,"I was bored from beginning to end, I didn't care about anything or anyone (but how can you when you can't tell all these white men apart) and even if I found some redeeming stuff (the cinematography comes to mind) I still couldn't enjoy this."
299,★★½,despacito
300,★★★★,"I'm sad that people are selling this as a war film. It's not a war film. It's a tense, gripping and humane film about survival. A great one at that."
301,Watched by,You can tell how much Hans Zimmer had to work to carry this film
302,★★★★½,a thrilling and breathtaking marvel. i appreciated it so much more the second time around.
303,★★½,why do directors keep making tom hardy cover his face
304,★★★★,Ich lieb die Ruhe in dem Film sehr.
305,★★★★★,Nolan really snapped with these cast choices huh
306,★★★★★,its literally as good as the first time maybe even better CHRISTOPHER NOLAN I LOVE YOU
307,★★★★★,Kenneth Branagh: This is a gays only event! Go home!
308,★★★★★,"I searched for ""intensity"" in the dictionary and found the poster of Dunkirk (2017)"

314,★★★★½,Easily the most underrated Christopher Nolan movie and some of his best work.

316,★★★★★,READ THE FULL REVIEW AT INDIEWIRE
317,★★★,Felt like a big budget documentary dramatization on the concept that war is in fact still a really bad time.
318,★★★,The score was so damn loud and aggressive that I felt as if Hans Zimmer was bashing my skull with a hammer for two hours straight
319,★★★★½,"IM THE ONLY ONE IN THE CINEMA THAT SHOUTED 'YOU'RE DOING AMAZING TOM HARDY"" BECAUSE THAT MAN DESERVE OSCAR BY HIS EYES ACTING"
320,★★★,could not tell who is who the entire movie because they literally all looked the same
321,★★,Y'all are just thirsty for Harry Styles. He's just one of countless twink bitches in this. What's the big deal?
322,★★★★,This is how my grandparents described how they got to school.
323,★★★★½,is a masterful experience.
324,★★★★★,"You can't spell ""hope"" without most of the letters in ""home"""
325,★★★★★,noooo cillian don't be scared you're so sexy
326,★★★★½,<9.1/10>
327,★★★★★,Getting to know when Nolan will announce plans for his next film.
328,★★★½,this was like a two hour long panic attack christopher why
329,★★★★★,The 4D experience of everyone drowning and me choking on Diet Coke
330,★★★½,"Short and sweet, seems like a different turn for Nolan but a highly realistic true story that holds the viewers attention right up until the last shot."
331,★★★★,heroes of Dunkirk are the people who watched it without subtitles
332,★★★★,War is ugly. Humanity is beautiful. Dunkirk shows both on epic proportions. This is probably one of the better war films in recent years and it does deserve the hype.
333,★★★★½,"can't say anything that hasn't been said already, but this is near flawless. so transcendently fluent, and so fantastic."
334,★★★★,whenever i lost harry styles in the sea of white men i just looked for the widest forehead. worked every time
335,★★★★,*
336,★★★★½,"Ok I was already pretty sure of this, but this 2nd viewing reassured me that this film far and away marks the best IMAX experience I've ever had. And yes I saw Gravity in IMAX too."
337,★★★★★,"Just when I thought the Apes would wind up winning the summer, in comes Christopher Nolan to snatch the shit away! An absolute pleasure to see his latest work in IMAX and I look forward to seeing it again tomorrow in regular 70mm!"
338,★★★★★,"The shot of the soldier just walking into the ocean, is the best."
339,★★★★,no one gets the unintentional homoerotic tension like christopher nolan
340,★★★★½,Watched on my projector at home and I really got to pay more attention to the grain of the film stock used and the changes from 35mm to 70mm IMAX
341,★★★½,me @ me: you actually thought you'd enjoy a war movie JUST because chris nolan directed it.... you played yourself...
342,★★★★★,"This was INCREDIBLE in 4K, holy crap."
343,★★★★★,"spitfire planes, every year we go to weymouth on holiday and we have seen the spitfire's so many times fly by !! also not to flex but we saw this movie being filmed in weymouth, we were like paparazzi near the weymouth harbour taking videos of the prop boats and all the set crew :)"
