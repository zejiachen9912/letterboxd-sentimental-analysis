0,★★★★★,"""Inception,"" at its most basic, is two things. It is a heist film dressed in science fiction conventions; and it is a study of a man trying to free himself from a near-suffocating past. ""Inception,"" at its more complex, is a cerebral pop-masterpiece. It is an enthralling combination of thought-provoking, layered story-telling and sumptuous aesthetics enhanced by near-flawless editing, sound design, effects, and musical score. Driven by a pitch-perfect cast and the confident directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, ""Inception"" is a brilliant and unrivaled piece of filmmaking."
1,★★★★★,cillian murphy: no dad i'm giving up on YOUR dream!
2,★★★★½,christopher nolan spent years writing this movie's complex plot and really named the main character dom cobb
3,★★★★½,Dom Cobb seems like he's never told a joke in his life and has zero friends
4,★★★★★,me: Gay
5,★★★★★,"""The most important emotional thing about the top spinning at the end is that Cobb is not looking at it. He doesn't care."" -Christopher Nolan, Wired interview, December 8, 2010."
6,★★★★½,how is joseph gordon-levitt? is he okay? where is he? is he being taken care of? is he safe? will he ever work again? what is he doing? is his career over? oh how I wish my husband would return from war
7,★★★★★,"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?"
8,★★★★★,me: I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
9,★★★★,living in your head rent free
10,★★★★½,ilysm (i love you scillian murphy)
11,★★★★★,tom hardy????
12,★★★★★,me: i love this gay/lesbian solidarity !!!
13,★★★★★,"if christopher nolan ever needs a script for the sequel, my arthur/eames fanfic is ready to go"
14,★★★★★,me: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???? IS HE DREAMING???? DID HE NOT WAKE UP????? WHAT IS THE TRUTH?????? I NEED ANSWERS!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!!!
15,★★★★★,me with my blu ray copy of inception already in my hand: okay im ready
16,★★★★★,I tried watching this movie with my dad but he just got mad and left because I wouldn't stop singing the score
17,★★★★★,eames: whom the fuck
18,★★★½,explaining the rules of the dream world to Ellen Page.
19,★★★★★,jgl sexy
20,★★★★★,"this is what dreams of dreams of dreams of dreams are made of, hey now!!"
21,Watched by,.
22,★★★½,way too hot
23,★★★★,snap back to reality
24,★★★★★,My mom told me not to trust people that don't like this movie.
25,★★★★½,i just cant get you out of my head
26,★★★★½,The fact that 'The King's Speech' won Best Picture over this is laughable.
27,★★★★★,(!!!) UGH I ALWAYS FORGET JUST HOW TRULY EXCELLENT IT IS I'M A SOBBING MESS RIGHT NOW
28,★★★★,I just think it's really neat.
29,★★★★½,"redeems the action genre by misdirecting from its formulaic bore and still holding up as one of the best of its kind, ten years later. I forgot how unique Christopher Nolan is as a director despite his massive accessibility. His creative talent and ambitious filmmaking are what make his films such an incredible experience to watch in theaters. The Hans Zimmer scores never get old, as well."
30,★★★★,"My guy Saito makes one phone call and gets a murder charge dropped? Yeah, Leo was definitely dreaming"
31,Watched by,finally watched inception
32,★★★★★,i think about that a lot
33,★★★★★,what I mean: tom hardy is really hot in this movie
34,★★★★,"The relationship between dreaming and movies, lucid dreaming and filmmaking. Pretty remarkable and increasingly difficult to not admire in retrospect - how did someone conceive of a cross between Marienbad and James Bond? Also perhaps emphasis on the retrospect - it's hard to imagine a film like this being made in the hyper-corporate climate of studio filmmaking today, and even sadder to realize that this was only nine years ago."
35,★★★★½,I would absolutely love to finish a christopher nolan film without having to go on wikipedia immediately after
36,★★★★,"Hans Zimmer's ""Time"" is one of the best things ever."
37,★★★★★,again... enjoyed both films alot.
38,★★★★★,"Can someone please stick a needle in me and let me slip into limbo, cause I wanna go build my dream castle"
39,★★★★,simulated catharsis is still catharsis.
40,★★★★★,"fellas, is it gay?"
41,★★★★★,being stuck in limbo with leonardo dicaprio doesn't seem like a bad idea to me
42,★★★★½,"academy voters be like ""was really confused when i saw 'written & directed by christopher nolan' at the end....... ur telling me this WASNT little women?? those timelines could've fooled me!"""
43,★★,"Watching this trash film was a toil, and I don't wish to waste additional time writing criticism on it. I will, however, draw attention to DiCaprio's spectacular hair, which is not in any way boring, disjointed, or derivative, or lacking in character development, or a mishmash of Nolan nonsense interspersed with gratuitous violence and gunplay."
44,★★★★★,"(the notorious b.i.g. voice) IT WAS ALL A DREAM, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN IS THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPREME"
45,Rewatched by,this fr gay as hell
46,★★★★½,"So epic it hurts. I'm willing to gloss over the few plot questions it leaves and just be enveloped by the killer combo of Nolan & Zimmer (whose soundtrack, incidentally, makes *everything* feel epic if you put it on loud enough)."
47,★★★★★,"Edit: one of my favorite endings ever, especially with the score."
48,★★★★½,tom hardy and joseph gordon-levitt... they are FUCKING each other
49,★★★★★,Music by Hans Zimmer. Directed and written by Christopher Nolan. All the actors smashed their rolls. Everything I need
50,★★★★★,"The camera focuses in on Arthur and Eames, over the directors commentary we hear Christopher Nolan speak. ""Two guys chilling in a dream world, five feet apart 'cause they're not gay."""
51,Rewatched by,what is limbo but beach that makes you old
52,★★★★★,The real cobb is nolan and The real inception is happened to us
53,★★★★½,my last brain cell is overheating like my macbook when I play poptropica for too long!!! I still cannot look at a top spinner the same!!!!
54,★★★★★,have the brains to create such astonishing satire?
55,★★,"""Edward E. Nigma......Enigma....."""
56,★★★★★,to rewatch
57,★★★★★,For a tenth anniversary piece. Still just rocks in terms of propulsion. It never stops moving.
58,★★★★★,I don't know what film those people who call this masterpiece overrated saw but this film definitely gets better the more you rewatch it and watching it with people who haven't seen it before is even better
59,★★★★,I need to see Tenet!
60,★★★★½,www.larsenonfilm.com/inception
61,★★★★★,"is that truly rare, intelligent summer blockbuster packed with ideas and concepts to keep the audience contemplating long after the credits. My favorite Nolan film."
62,★★★★★,my hair is not only falling out due to the stress of watching this but also the fact we still haven't had an ellen page/nolan collab since this
63,★★★★★,Overall Rating: A+
64,★★★★½,nolan be casting his movies like: yeah this should make em horny. drop it
65,★★★,what the he-fuck is going on???
66,★★★★★,Yeah.
67,★★★★★,arthur: eames this is verbal conversation
68,★★★★½,"Yes, it's as good as everyone says. I really wish I saw it in theaters. I wish more blockbusters were like this. Can't wait for Tenet now. The cast has no business being this fine. Thank you for everything, Cillian Murphy."
69,★★★★★,"me, deciding which film to put on while i try to nap on the plane: i'm gonna get real meta with it"
70,★★★★★,ba dum tss
71,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan Ranked
72,Rewatched by,executive produced by emma thomas (his wife)
73,★★★★★,ending shot had me and dad up off the couch screaming about whether it would topple or not
74,★★★★½,electric chair [slams gavel]
75,★★★★½,My aunt carol died this morning
76,★★★★,nolan: yes
77,★★★★,is Christopher Nolan secretly an employee for pharmaceutical companies because I always seem to get headaches from watching his films
78,★★★★★,.
79,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan planted an idea in my mind. that I would love this movie. and I did!
80,★★★★★,"mostly had it on as background noise while i read arthur/eames fanfiction from 2010 but it's my letterboxd and i get to choose what counts as ""watching a film"""
81,★★★★★,So i was ten years old and i decided to watched this movie instead of despicable me iconic
82,★★★★★,"Remember when yusuf flipped the van and then looked back to his passengers and said ""yall see that? hah- oh yea they're asleep, how could they possibly have seen it? Idiot. Once again you have embarrassed yourself in front of the audience, yusuf."" --? Mr. Bean shit."
83,★★★★★,just like cobb I too have marion cotillard living in my head rent free
84,★★★,"Ok, this is quite a smart movie for it's mamuschka concept. But the emotional impact is beyond zero. There are massive action sequences, but you just don't care for anybody in the movie - which sadly makes it pretty uninteresting to watch."
85,★★★★★,It's quite excellent!
86,★★★★½,RTX off: Tenet
87,★★★★,i relate to dom cobb because if marion cotillard was my wife and i lost her id also be so depressed that i could barely emote
88,★★★★★,every day i argue with myself over if this is the stupidest easiest simplest score ever written and how that might actually make it genius
89,★★★★½,"I, too, dream about Cillian Murphy"
90,★★★★★,my dad won't speak to me now bc i sang along to the score for the entire duration of the movie those BWAH BWAHHHHs r music 2 my ears
91,★★★★½,HERE
92,★★★★★,"Now, I can hear the dramatic symphony music playing so I should wake up any seco-"
93,★★★★,Every night when I fall asleep the full duration of this film is streamed into my consciousness. When the movie ends (credits and all) I wake up. I was really confused until 2010 when this movie came out. Neat!
94,★★★★★,"As far as directing the film is concerned, each of its elements cinematography, special effects, sound, score, editing and acting are masterfully achieved."
95,★★★★,"Alright, bumping it up half a star because man the visuals and score of the film are amazing and so appealing. Even the muted colors pop and it's just a blast visually. Some gripes, especially with the script, probably are going to prevent it from getting a full five from me. Oh well."
96,★★★★★,Inception is one of the greatest serve in the history of film no one can change my mind
97,★★★★½,Mudkip.
98,Watched by,the sexual tension between joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy is stronger and more powerful than a dream within a dream within a dream
99,★★★★½,"Total side note, that score was insanely good."
100,★★★★,"""I WANT A GODDAMN CLOCK!!!...if I had a clock...I would-fuck it..."" -Christopher Nolan probably"
101,★★★★★,so many thoughts head full
102,★★★★★,"Inception is a brilliant film. Christopher Nolan twists our minds in millions of pieces with this complex film. He knows how to combine true spectacular direction, with symbolic concepts about our perception of reality as how we can trap ourselves in lives and ideas that don't necessarily reflect the reality. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job. The ""dream world"" dream within' a dream moments and the theory of time slowing are fun mind puzzles to unravel. The action is well paced and suspenseful. The music score and settings all flow together well. Overall, Inception is excellent."
103,Rewatched by,"Damn, they must be so well rested."
104,★★★★,BWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
105,★★★★★,"with a hint of actual intelligence must admit that Inception is, in fact, pretty fucking great."
106,★★★★,congrats to the first film here to reach 1M!
107,★★★★★,", man?! This week isn't soon enough. A few hours from right now would be more ideal. Like, it would be great if I could just sleep for a few hours and then wake up in the theater as Nolan's latest is beginning. Is that so much to ask?? This goddamn wait feels as if I've been stuck in limbo for 50 years myself. What the shit."
108,★★★★,ps ily cillian murphy you're so pretty and i wish i could kiss u and feel your soft skin and play with your silky hair... god im lonely and needy
109,★★★★,sleep is cool
110,★★★★★,Bravo Nolan!
111,★★★★★,10/10
112,★★★★,leonardo dickaprio out here sleeping on the job smh
113,★★★★★,"arthur, stacking people on top of each other, tying them together and blowing up a lift to give them the kick: sorry i can't hear you"
114,Rewatched by,boy am i ever waiting for a train
115,★★★★½,The Oscar Rewind podcast link
116,★★★★★,And DiCaprio deserves his own franchise at this point.... dude is so good in this.... so is the whole cast
117,★★★★★,tom hardy arriving to inception set: i am going to create an environment that is so homoerotic
118,★★★★★,joseph gordon-levitt i am in love with you
119,★★★★★,"I'm sorry I missed your birthday yesterday, Inception, you'll have to forgive me considering the amount of times I've watched you already. We have an understanding, me and you. An arrangement. Honour it. Or you'll become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone."
120,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan: *shoots me in the face*
121,★★★★★,- INCEPTION ON THE BIG SCREEN?!?!?:):!:!:
122,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
123,★★★★½,This remains the only Tom Hardy performance where I can understand 100% of his dialogue.
124,★★★★★,There is no longer solution.
125,★★★★★,"Through Inception, Christopher Nolan takes us to explore everything that is achievable in cinema, and beyond."
126,★★★★★,Everyone wish inception a happy birthday
127,★★★★★,jgl hot
128,★★★★★,robert fischer please let me hold you and kiss you and take care of you
129,★★★★★,(This gets better with every watch)
130,★★★,"It tracks that Nolan, just a few years older than me, probably really dug A View to a Kill and it's epic ski scene."
131,★★★★★,"do you reckon anyone's told christopher nolan about the arthur/eames phenomenon yet?? and if not, can i be the one to break into his house in the middle of the night and start reading out a coffee shop au while he looks on, presumably enraptured"
132,★★★★★,watching this at 1:30 in the morning hits different
133,Rewatched by,twitter.com/responsiblerob/status/1295946276966522882?s=21

138,★★★★★,WHAT
139,★★★★★,"First time I watched this movie I was too young to really appreciate it, but I absolutely love it now. This was so much fun to watch. Also, Cillian Murphy is very underrated and deserves bigger roles."
140,★★★★★,what if we kissed three levels down in ur dreamscape
141,★★★★★,Iconic.
142,★★★★½,Not too much to say that hasn't been said. I really want to rewatch this.
143,★★★★½,is probably his best film from a technical standpoint.
144,★★★★½,"I hate Chris Nolan, in the best possible way."
145,★★★★★,vm.tiktok.com/ZMe2QV5ud/

148,★★★★★,plays in the end fucking give me literal CHILLS
149,★★★★,Bitch...!
150,★★★★★,at the theaters when it came out so i couldn't miss the opportunity to make this my first movie watched in theaters after 249 days and i'll be watching THE DARK FUCKING KNIGHT in a few minutes!!!!!!! you guys don't have idea of how happy i'm right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
151,★★★★★,"is even halfway as good as this fucking movie, we're in for a goddamn treat."
152,★★★★,so confused but yes agreed
153,★★★★★,"Anyways, play ""Time"" at my funeral, please and thank you. I want all of you weeping."
154,★★★★★,I can relate to Arthur because I too am in love with Eames.
155,★★★★½,?
156,★★★★½,must one understand a film? is it not enough to simply be in awe of it and thirst over the lead actors?
157,★★★★★,JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream
158,★★★★★,"(Based on that, my new big dream is hack Leo's mind and spend 50 years building a city with him, bye)"
159,★★★★,"as a female in architecture school i really loved ellen page's character because i, too, would ask ZERO questions if leonardo dicaprio approached me and asked me to illegally design worlds for people's dreams"
160,★★★★★,"I discover something new about this film, so I'm pretty sure I will never get tired of it."
161,★★★★,"When I was an early teen hyped as fuck on this picture I showed it to my mom. Every once in a while I'd catch her in my peripheral vision looking completely wrapped up in the story, eyes laser-focused with a smirk on her face. It seemed as though she was ascending. By the end, I asked what she thought and she said she had zero clue as to what was happening and was just enamored by the sight of Leo and Tom Hardy. Love her lol."
162,★★★★★,). I am indeed crying.
163,★★★★½,Good.
164,★★★★★,you are showing off
165,★★★★★,i feel that
166,★★★★,p.s. u were kinda cute in the 90s when u looked like a depeche mode reject
167,★★★★★,Thanks for reading!
168,Added by,review should be up tomorrow night around 9pm
169,★★★★★,christopher nolan please fucking tell me 2020 is just a dream inside a dream
170,★★★★★,This mind bending film certainly lived up to the expectations that I had for it. Tom Hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio are my favourites in this film they both put on great performances. Great action and extremely memorable scenes. Sure some of it may be complex and hard to get your head around but overall inception will be a classic forever.
171,★★★★½,"We are Hans Zimmer stans first, and humans second."
172,★★★★½,my brain is scrambled eggs
173,★★★★,"makes the upright, straight-faced professionalism of his characters here feel more palatable. The scene with Tom Hardy telling Joseph Gordon-Levitt to ""dream a little bigger, darling"" is one of those increasingly rare instances where you can see the exact moment someone becomes an A-list movie star."
174,★★★★★,FUCK IT FIVE STARS
175,★★★★,This must be a dream... right?
176,★★★★★,new drinking game: take a shot everytime someone says the word 'subconscious'
177,★★★★½,Anyways inception is cool !
178,★★★★,cillian murphy
179,★★★★★,she only refers to cillian as cheekbones
180,★★★★★,i know i'm nine years late but HOLY SHIT
181,★★★★★,"christopher edward nolan i love you and your wonderful, beautiful, incredible, WILD MIND!"
182,★★★★★,"which is gayer, being lgbtq+ or arthur and eames?"
183,★★★★★,"Watched this in school today. I hadn't seen this in nearly three years, so I totally forgot how mindblowingly smart and heartpoudingly intense it is. I'm not gonna write a lot, but I just gotta say that it'll definitely be moving up on my list (along with its younger brother Interstellar). Pure genius. Nolan's aptitude for perfecting heady ideas, narrative momentum, and emotional stakes never fails to astound me. A modern masterpiece that will probably go down as the greatest movie of the past ten years."
184,★★★,) being in your four favorites is without a doubt the biggest red flag there is
185,★★★★★,if you see me log cillian murphy's entire filmography no you didn't
186,★★★★★,Exposition is fun when it's interesting.
187,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
188,★★★★★,is just something out of this world.
189,★★★★★,LITERALLY NOTHING GETS ME MORE HYPED THAN THAT FUCKING HALLWAY SCENE!!!! YES SPIN AROUND!!! CRAWL ON THE WALL JGL!!!!!
190,★★★★★,by now it's one of my comfort movies so there is that
191,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan is truly a god when is comes to cinema!
192,★½,"One of the more interesting dreams I've had in my life was when I had to protest Barack Obama's attempts to repossess my long deceased grandmother's house, despite the fact the building itself was in Northern Ireland. There ain't any shit like that in this movie. There is, however, abstraction disguised as subject beholden composition, intellect masquerading as an abundance of words, and corporate malfesance made into the engine of ""pure creation"". Certifiably a film that never improves."
193,★★★★★,was at the airport and being the dramatic b!tch that i am i listened to time by hans zimmer
194,★★★★★,"Some people thought it was too confusing. If anything, I'd wished it was more confusing. It's the perfect organized chaos. Christopher Nolan did a perfect job writing and directing such a convoluted plot into a masterpiece."
195,★★★★★,"Not gonna write much, but yeah this is almost certainly making the top spot of the decade list. Really emotionally resonant and conceptually intriguing to me even after my exposure to art-house and other, more obscure films. The narrative momentum, tension, structure, and music go hand-in-hand to make for one of the most enthralling experiences, and it really blows me away every time."
196,★★★★,"(I'll swear I'll rewatch this and do a better review, it was really visually stunning and the whole concept was seriously great.)"
197,★★★★★,Happy Birthday Christopher Nolan :)
198,★★★★★,"tom hardy calling joseph gordon-levitt darling, that's very pleasant to me."
199,Rewatched by,"Amazing to see and hear on the big ass screen, the wooooommmmmmms even drowned out when Alice fell asleep."
200,★★★★,"More Tom Berenger in good movies, please!"
201,★★★★★,Inception is brilliant tho
202,★★,And we are all its prisoners.
203,★★★★★,This is just a masterpiece of film making. Everything from the score to the acting is outstanding. Could watch it again right now after just watching it.
204,★★★★★,Arthur + Eames walked so Protagoneil could run
205,★★★★★,"This film still holds up today for so many reasons. I wanna talk about probably my favorite part of the film and that has to be the action. This movie has beautiful editing, special effects, and much more. It has a great and interesting story that is entertaining the whole way. Along with, great characters, great actors, and perfect casting choice. The end of this film has such a strong feeling to it you can easily connect to it and how the characters are feeling. 10/10. Must watch."
206,★★★★,"Fun, clever, cinematic, it's one of Nolan's best."
207,★★★★★,"""An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you."""
208,★★★★½,made me like that one a lot less.
209,★★★★½,watched this for the first time on my birthday back in july and was sorta mehhh on it back then but i decided to rewatch it tonight and totally understood it more and WOW ok christopher nolan really snapped
210,★★½,Me: I hope Tenet is better than this
211,★★★★★,I actually had thought of this movie years before it came out. But Nolan just had to extract it from me. My totem is a chewed pencil that my ex left on my desk before she left me for Sven Baker. It still smells like her... And sadness... And Sven....
212,★★★★★,c u f e
213,★★★★,"paprika, is that you?"
214,★★★★★,joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy are so gay in this movie
215,★★★★★,"my braincells worked so hard today especially now after I rewatched this movie, I'm gonna need a therapy or just a deep sleep with dream within a dream within a dream"
216,★★★★★,STFU NO WHAt IM NOT OKAY. SO DID HE NOT WAKE UP IS HE LOST IN HIS MIND FOREVER IM NOT OKAH WHAG THE FUCK
217,★★★★★,History has just written. It' the first film in Letterboxd that reached 1 million viewers.
218,★★★★★,it lived up to all the hullabaloo... letterboxd users you win this round
219,★★★★★,perfect movie that I saw 4 times in theaters and my parents got so mad
220,★★★★★,The coolest therapy session of all time.
221,Added by,here
222,★★★★★,and they were dreammates
223,★★★★★,EDIT: Still a phenomenal movie despite characters running around and throwing projectiles at the screen.
224,★★★★★,100%
225,★★★★★,no i did not rewatch i just wanted to say that spotify wrapped said that time by hans zimmer was my 2nd top song
226,★★★★★,this is not something they made... like this is some professional shit!! like this shit is in different areas man... what the fuck!
227,★★★★★,2) mal is the most annoying character
228,★★★★½,"Please... Play ""Time"" by Hans Zimmer at my funeral... Which is right now, because Nolan just killed me."
229,Rewatched by,wow lots of this movie is a bunch of explaining
230,★½,Bro Nolan hates his wife
231,★★★★½,post nolan film headaches are the best kind of headaches
232,★★★★,"Wow, the first time I watched this was 4 years ago. I can't believe it has been so long. I wasn't really impressed by it, probably due to the high expectations I had. This time around, I think I liked it more and found the dream bending experience more impressive than my first time viewing, but I still need to give this another go."
233,★★★★★,HANS ZIMMER DIDN'T HAVE TO GO SO HARD FOR THIS SCORE FUCK
234,★★★★★,I wish I saw these in theaters
235,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
236,½,Inception is one of the worst movies ever made
237,★★★★½,"I cannot stop mentioning how incredibly well this movie is written, produced, acted, shot and scored. It is a master piece! This is the kind of flick that you sit down and let it overwhelm you with it's greatness. It is a must watch! Bravo!"
238,★★★★★,movie ending.
239,★★★★,"Well, this was a lot better than I remembered. One of those films where it actually feels like you've been through an absolutely, unbelievably epic journey when the credits start rolling."
240,Rewatched by,"okay, those that know me will know that i adore chris nolan and he's my second favourite director of all time, which is why i wish i understooor this, literally i'm confused from the opening scene, and rewatching it doesn't help me, can anyone help?"
241,★★★★★,"the acting is fantastic, the cinematography is fantastic, the cast is fantastic, I guess that's what's to be expected from a film with cillian murphy, tom hardy and leo dicaprio they really are the holy trinity c'mon guys"
242,★★★★★,*plays Time for the 100000th time*
243,★★★★★,way to watch Inception is via the in-game big screen in Fortnite.
244,★★★★½,if joseph gordon-levitt asked me for a kiss out of the blue i would also happily oblige and do it with no hesitations
245,★★★★★,"cillian murphy, elliot page, and joseph gordon-levitt are enough to turn me hetero y'all. inception was really just a conversion therapy scheme this whole time"
246,★★★★★,Happy New Year (soon) everyone! :)
247,★★★★★,i think joSeph gordon levitt is pretty neat
248,★★★★★,I love everything and every single second of this breathtaking movie.
249,★★★★★,I was drawing while finishing this and at one point I looked up and saw Saito with his mouth like on something (he was taking the pin out of a grenade) and for a split second I honestly thought he had stopped to eat a fucking sandwich
250,★★★★,Hans Zimmer is THE man
251,★★★★★,i was thinking about how much i hate int*rst*llar earlier so i watched this and now i've calmed down also i'm bald
252,★★★★★,(School really does be taking up my time smh)
253,★★★★★,"No I do not have issues with this film because I'm not an arrogant teenager with ""fully formed opinions"", and nor am I in my misery-addicted and hateful 40s."
254,★★★★★,even after watching this so many times
255,★★★★★,i also dream about cillian murphy
256,★★★★★,I would like to thank the costume department for joseph gordon levitt's pants
257,★★★★½,"Not bad. I don't fully understand why they had a scene of Tom Hardy saying the n-word. Maybe I will after another rewatch, but for now, I have to remove half a star from it for doing that."
258,★★★★★,the feeling that i get from the end of this movie is actually indescribable like i can't even put it into words it gets me every single time
259,★★★★★,i just want to live inside christopher nolan's mind how the fuck does he come up with things like this
260,★★★★★,The first time I watched Inception was July 2017 and it blew my f^^king mind the movie is superb.Christopher Nolan is a goddamn genius and the performances by Leonardo was fantastic. overall I give it 10/10.

268,★★★★,Christopher Nolan think loud mean excite and like to explain with big word for 90 min no stop but then the really inceptiony stuff starts going down and in the end is game changer I like rrrrrr

280,★★★★★,"Another Nolan masterpiece, great acting, action, story...Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic."
281,★★★★½,hans zimmer really went for it on the keyboard
282,★★★★★,The real question is... Did it stop spinning at the end?
283,★★★★★,Hypnotic as ever
284,★★★★★,"no YOU live in a society, i live in the christopher nolan cinematic universe"
285,★★★★★,NAHHH.... YALL I HAVE FUCKING CHILLSSSSSS IDC THIS SHIT IS GOING STRAIGHT TO MY FAVOIRITES
286,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan write a female character whose existence doesn't revolve around a man challenge
287,★★★★★,"I still don't understand how one man was able to think of this story, Christopher Nolan's mind!"
288,★,Paprika mal hecha we.
289,★★★★★,"Amazing movie with great acting, great set pieces, spectacular visuals and special effects and a confusing but interesting story. 10/10"
290,★★★★★,"this made me realise how many intense screamy angsty roles leo keeps taking....... guy needs to take a chill pill, do a romcom or something"

297,★★★★★,"Christopher Nolan: ""You must not be afraid to dream a little bigger darling."
298,★★★★★,the plot: robert fischer
299,★★★★½,Woah. What a great story.
300,★★★★½,"Despite it being 85 percent exposition I still enjoy every bit of it. It's so intricate. Would have worked better as a novel than a film for the layers (literally) he was going for. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at and highly envisioned, it's just hard not to wish Nolan could make these real and vivid worlds with real and vivid characters. Probably will rewatch again soon with some sort of analysis. We'll see if I can stomach the plot-talk. Also I always forget Tom Hardy is in this. God bless him."
301,★★★★★,inception is a ridiculous movie. im supposed to believe joseph gordon levitt can knock guys out in one punch?
302,★★★★½,nolan movies based on how important time is
303,★★★★½,oh ya super cool plot btw!
304,★★★★★,i had unholy thoughts for jgl throughout the entire film <3
305,★★★★½,Just needed something to take my mind off the world today. This did the trick.
306,★★★★★,Just rewatched it wow I think it might be my favorite film of all time now
307,★★★★,"Anyways, this movie is sick still."
308,★★★★★,idk who chose to put this back in cinemas but whoever you are I just wanna say I LOVE YOU
309,★★★★★,did i know what was happening at all times? no. did i still love it anyway? yes.
310,★★★★★,BWAHHHHHH
311,★★★★½,ldc ranked
312,★★★★★,Nolan
313,★★★★★,Holds up to the high standards of my middle school self and I am so happy for that.
314,★★★★★,wow tom hardy and leo dicap in a movie together is what dreams are made of
315,★★★★,"Architecture, mazes, Penrose stairs, dream-time vs real time... my left brain had a blast with this movie! The logical side tried to find flaws but couldn't. Well-filmed, pretty airtight, and with a solid cast. It's been a long time since I've watched a sci-fi gem like that."
316,★★★★,I especially liked the altered-gravity fight scenes.
317,★★★★★,It makes too much sense that Christopher Nolan's idea of a dreamscape is just different versions of a Michael Mann movie
318,★★★★★,my little brother was watching this in fortnite so i watched with him (we didn't finish). just wanted to write this so i would remember i once watched some of one of the BEST FILMS EVER MADE in fortnite. wow. what a sentence.
319,★★★★★,"I'm going to be thinking about the ending of this movie for a long time, but all I know is that this film is one of the best films I've ever seen."
320,★★★★★,"These guys had a very intellectual dream about planting an idea in another person's mind. Meanwhile, I had this weird dream about making sandwich with my professor in a swimming pool"
321,★★★★★,breaking news: cillian murphy has a WAP
322,★★★★★,My Favourites Films List
323,★★★★★,still the best movie ever me thinks
324,★★★★½,An elegant solution to keeping track of reality
325,★★★★,The Dark Knight.
326,★★★★,here :)
327,★★★★★,can we get an inception 2 where eames just bullies arthur for two hours thanks <3
328,★★★★★,christopher nolan is my hero
329,★★★★,"and I'm only like a third of the way in but I was expecting it to completely change the way I watch the movie, but there was literally zero difference. I don't have time to think about metaphors, radical skepticism and Descartes, I'm too busy enjoying an amazing movie."
330,★★★½,"I think i missed the whole point of this film as I sit here thinking that, if possible, I would probably end up like Cobb, revisiting old memories of lost loved ones over and over again."
331,★★★★½,"so, this is where it starts; the dead wife, the loud score by hans zimmer.. that turns christopher nolan, into who he is today i guess"
332,★★★★★,is this the real life? is this just fantasy? caught in a landslide no escape from reality...
333,★★★★★,Und einem besonderen Ende
334,★★★★★,arthur and eames were gay I know this because I'm their daughter and they raised me
335,★★★★★,"One big messy dream that can make a lot of sense in multiple ways. But it's all just a dream. Therefore there can be no plot holes. Therefore there can be no flaws. Therefore if ever there was a ""perfect film"" it is this one."
336,★★★★½,Oh and yeah issa banger
337,★★★★★,Wonderful moment.
338,★★★,I watched this in Fortnite
339,★★★★★,Edit: I'm bumping this up to 5 stars because I keep thinking about it
340,★★★★,"One of the most memorable Mystery/Sci-Fi flicks from the 2010's, this is a clever and entertaining Hollywood spectacle as orchestrated by the always competent Christopher Nolan. While I don't personally adore it as much as other people, I can only recognize its qualities and the final scene perfectly suited to Hans Zimmer's ""Epic and not at all subtle but we love him for it Score"" still remains one of the best ""frustrating yet absolutely perfect"" ending ever put to film."
341,★★★,agree with this grade - COMMENT
342,★★★★★,The best film of the century thus far.
343,★★★★½,Though it might not be the surrealistic piece some people claim it to be since everything happening is literally being explained without staying too ambiguous it also doesn't need to be that because it's phenomenal the way it is. Just a proper good movie
344,★★★★★,"No matter how many times someone stops to point that fact out, it will always remain true."
345,★★★★,undeniable modern classic
346,★★★★★,"talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before"
347,★★★★★,gotta remind myself that christopher nolan can make good movies
348,★★★★★,ROBERT FISCHER NATION RISE
349,Watched by,10th anniversary
350,★★★★½,"This was actually only my second viewing of Inception, I saw it for the first time a few years ago. I really enjoyed it, such a great and unique take on the Heist genre whilst still being an original sci-fi blockbuster!"
351,★★★★,"did not pay attention at all, spent nearly the entire time on twitter, just wanted to sit through this so i could log it with the tag fortnite"
352,★★★★★,I love this film with all my heart.
353,★★★★★,will be rewatching IMMEDIATELY
354,★★★★★,Super excited for Tenet.
355,★★★★★,Inception is absolutely the greatest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. I must clarify though that I have only seen five other movies all the way through and one of those is four episodes of Californication back to back so idk if that counts. Inception is that rare movie that reaches new heights of cinema and visual art. It is inspiring as fuck and that is why I am proud to announce it made me realize my new passion in life: I am moving to Hollywood tomorrow to find Christopher Nolan and make him teach me how to direct mindfuck movies.
356,★★★★★,My brain hurts
357,★★★★★,something happened in 2010 that changed us forever and this is what it was
358,★★★★★,best final shot ever yup yup.... chris nolan you big tease x
359,★★★★★,a mindfuck nightmare. a technical masterpiece. inception is everything you can imagine and more. this is such a 5 star movie that im almost embarrassed that I only found that about that today. one of those rides that you hardly forget. I know I will not
360,★★★,"i will watch this again one day, and hopefully will understand and like it way more, but for now this was my third nolan film in one day and i'm exhausted, drained, and just thinking about this movie makes my head hurt"
361,★★★★★,.
362,★★★★★,The hall sequence will always be one of my favorite scenes of all time. PERIODT
363,★★★★,explaining onion layers to donkey.
364,★★★★★,"The more I think about this, the more I love it with all my heart. A timeless classic that I'll never get sick of."
365,★★★★★,robert fischer let me hold u i love u
366,★★★★½,Still great. Just have to remind myself that sometimes.
367,★★★★★,Saw it in theaters for the 10 year anniversary. It was also my first time ever seeing it in theaters because I missed it in 2010. Man what an experience. It was especially fun because I showed my mom the movie for the first time and she LOVED it!
368,★★★★,everyone in this film is gorgeous im so glad i finally bowed to the peer pressure and watched it
369,★★★★½,"Is this the unquestionable peak of dudebro, ""well, actually..."" cinema? Of course it is, and unashamedly so. That said, however, 2010 me was all head over heels for the slick aesthetics and practical, stunt-driven sci-fi spectacle. A decade on, 2020 me is still about all of those things, but now I'm also out here with mad respect for the finely-tuned, matryoshka frame narratives that sing and resonate with each resounding Zimmer ""BRRAAAMMMM"". Paradox indeed."
370,★★★★½,I watched this over FaceTime with friends and they made a bunch of unwelcome conversations about subjects like brown bottles of listerine
371,★★★★★,yeah I just watched it in fortnite. and what about it
372,★★★★★,Love this film just as much as I did the first time. An absolute masterpiece.
373,★★★★★,the cultural reset in question
374,★★★★★,wasn't the best Original Screenplay and Motion Picture of 2010.
375,★★★★½,Keep on spinning...
376,★★★★★,"This movie has so many layers (literally) and so many details I still have to discover or understand. To write something like this must've been hell or a joy. Either way, I'm looking forward to Nolan's next big action blockbuster..."
377,★★★★,Someone planted a seed in my mind to give this movie a good review So what can I say but just mind-blowing
378,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
379,★★★★½,"Coupled with an excellent cast, superb set pieces and the fact that Nolan manages to squeeze some emotion into the mix, Inception is Hollywood filmmaking done well."
380,★★★★★,!!!
381,★★★★½,"Was looking forward to my (just) second viewing of it, but now can clearly say, that INTERSTELLAR was quiet a jump in Nolans oevre. I did forget how much Nolan is/was into pure Genre Cinema (part 2)."
382,★★★★★,"Short Review: Style meets substance. They get married and spent 50 years in subconscious limbo, playing God and creating all manner of awesome structures. Then they have a falling-out and try to kill each other, chasing each other through complex labyrinths. Then they wake up from one dream after another after another, meticulously crafting a sublime plot with a ton of deep ideas as they do so. That's just how cool this film is."
383,★★★★★,Inception.
384,★★★★★,me @ cillian
385,★★★★★,Truly speechless.
386,★★★★½,"Wahnsinn, was Mr. Nolan da geschaffen hat."
387,★★★★,Im gonna have weird dreams tonight
388,★★★★★,It's been way too long since I've seen this movie and I almost forgot how much I loved it! It's a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned. My favorites: Arthur and Eames.
