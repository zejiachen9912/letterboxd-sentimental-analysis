5,★★★★★,"""Fuck it, let's make a movie backwards"""
6,★★★★,Nolan cast Joey Pants in a movie again you coward
7,★★★½,I wish I was one of those intellectuals who can watch and enjoy this movie without commenting on how much they enjoy shirtless guy pearce
8,★★★★,and it's a rewatch.
9,★★★★,Dawg I am just as confused as Leonard
10,★★★★,"This is still a really good movie, small but audacious, an exciting and sad high-concept. If THE PRESTIGE is Nolan's manifesto this is his Rosetta Stone. He deserves a chunk of the flack he gets, but these aren't mean tricks."
11,★★★★,fuck the what
12,★★★★★,This is super creative and unique. I'm still confused but I still loved what I saw. I might have Leonard's condition...I'm not kidding cause every time I'm about to take a test I always forget what I studied. HONESTLY Christopher Nolan is a genius.
13,★★★½,my head be hurting thank u nolan
14,★★★★★,"each of Nolan's first three films are about a walking ghost who doesn't know he's dead, and this is the best one of them"
15,★★★★,Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
16,★★★★★,"unfurls an intelligent and well-scripted narrative with the employment of some delusional composites of recollection and truth. The remorse and misconceptions of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) are slowly illustrated, through the careful writing and direction of Christopher Nolan, into an excavation into an intriguingly questionable narration that gazes into a chasm of insanity and addiction, but which continues to be a compelling mystery long after the exposure of its necessary disclosures. This early Nolan triumph of misdirection moves miles beyond a conventional narrative hook to develop a classic noir of reverse chronology."
17,★★★★★,The rare puzzle movie that holds up no matter how many times I watch it.
18,★★★★½,me: guy pearce hot
19,★★★½,watching this movie had me feeling like i actually lost my short-term memory... i would NOT be able to recount the chronological order of events for you

25,★★★★,"I often have no idea what happened yesterday, but I really don't worry too much about it."
26,★★★★,the plot: guy pearce being shirtless for 90 minutes straight
27,★★★★½,Woah! And I thought Inception was the movie that blew my mind the most.
28,★★★★½,What's crazy is that this movie came out 18 years ago. That means I was like 5 years old when Christopher Nolan was making this wonderful masterpiece. 18 years later and he's still making masterpieces and I'm busy still acting like a 5 year old.
29,★★★,#ReleaseTheChronologicalCut
30,★★★★½,is no different. The format of the movie is amazing. The viewer starts out as confused as Leonard is. The puzzle slowly reveals itself until we get the entire picture.

44,★★★★½,"I've seen a lot of people say this movie isn't as great on a rewatch, once you know the full story, because of the backwards timeline gimmick. I have to strongly disagree! Knowing where it leads does not take away from the masterclass of creative storytelling Nolan presents there, nor does it take away from the impact of the message he's trying to get across. And do I even need to bring up how great the cast is? A fantastic and fascinating film, whether it's your first viewing or not."
45,★★★★★,Best Nolan movie?
46,★★★★★,"My favourite film by Nolan. A fun ride and a very smart film. Every cut is precise, no information is given if it would give a different insight to the sequence we're currently watching."
47,★★★★★,imagine how perfect this movie would be if it was scored by Hans Zimmer
48,★★★★,"Brilliant. A truly masterful screenplay by the Nolan brothers. By telling the story backwards, what would normally be simple exposition becomes thrilling reveals."
49,★★★½,bitches always be losing some braincells everytime they watch a nolan movie. it's me. i am bitches.
50,★★★★½,this was SO GOOD on a rewatch holy shit
51,★★★★½,"hearts beat idyllically in the silence of the past. uncovering sins through ink trailing skin melts ideas down into truth. moments skate within the reckless stream, transcending space and time. sticky blood spills across fragments of you; memories slip from the mind."
52,Rewatched by,"Saw this film 3x in May, 2001."
53,★★★★★,"is one of the most unique and complicated movies I have ever seen, and it's brilliant. Christopher Nolan has no trouble proving his cinematic brilliance in this well thought out and scripted drama."
54,★★★★,The only way to get out of this predicament is to put my car in reverse motion. Reverse chronology is the name of the game here my friend.
55,★★★★½,50 first dates + shutter island + overboard + finding dory + inception = memento
56,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan Retrospective: Film #2
57,★★★★,Extreme confusion does not begin to describe how this movie is unraveling. I had to watch it twice in order to somewhat make sense of the was happening. The plot is very intriguing and original. Definitely worth watching if you don't mind being completely confused throughout the movie.
58,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan wants to mess up our concept of time SO BADLY
59,★★★★★,This film would be nearly impossible to follow if they played it chronologically but Nolan decided that would be too easy apparently.

63,★★★★★,A simply genius piece of work.
64,Watched by,i thought i was going to have a hard time understanding but i actually didn't and i followed along pretty well. i think it's fair to say that christopher nolan is one of the best directors of this age and this is proof. i can't say much that hasn't already been said but wow this was truly an experience.
65,Watched by,"I couldn't remember if I liked this or not, but I found a note telling me to give it 4.5 stars"
66,★★★★½,"succeeds where Tenet failed in using its reverse time gimmick as a narrative style rather than a plot device. It incorporates seamlessly into Nolan's breakthrough film, mirroring the protagonist's mental state for the audience, and therefore indirectly involving us with the unfolding and interpretation of said story. If Nolan could go back to unique storytelling formats rather than plot themes, then he might have another modern classic on his hands."
67,★★★★½,You know a film is good when you copy the actions of the protagonist after watching it. I was walking around my house trying to remember to remember everything I did in case I forgot it.
68,★★★½,"Hi, my name is Christopher Nolan, and I think simple, straightforward films are for MORONS!"

74,★★★★½,"I'll have to rewatch this film to try and make some more sense of what it all means. Maybe then I'll bump the rating up. But for now, all I can say is see this, but prepare yourself for a mindfuck that will leave you asking more questions then there are answers."
75,★★★★½,not as good as interstellar tho

81,★★★★,mr nolan I am so sorry but I fell asleep like halfway through and had the best nap of my entire life. I did watch it again and this film was good and guy pearce is so hot but my nap was better
82,★★★★½,"I realized as I was starting this that I hadn't seen it for nearly four years so it was definitely high time that I revisit it. And it's still incredible. Everything here is so intriguing and haunting (not to mention even sadder than I remember it being). I think the very end isn't quite as flawless as I thought it was, but it's honestly still amazing. Yeah, I won't apologize for loving Nolan, these are the movies that shaped me."
83,★★★★★,9.6/10
84,★★★½,And you thought Dory had bad short-term memory loss.
85,★★½,Now I feel like I have short term memory loss
86,★★★★,((((((((((((((((((((((; movie the like backwards is review this
87,★½,And forget all about this film
88,★★★★★,"Memento is one the best noir mystery thrillers ever made. Lenny (Guy Pearce) is excellent, has anterograde amnesia that is seeking revenge for his injury and his wife's murder. He's only cognizant of brief spans of the present before his short term memory is lost. The film is edited to instill this same feeling of uncertainty of facts, relationships and self-trust in the viewer. I usually love Christopher Nolan films and this one is no different, great story, creative narrative structure and believable acting. Overall, it's an amazing piece of art and one of Christopher Nolan's greatest achievements."
89,★★★★,"this is one of the best brain exercise that you can get. even i had a fifteen minute dilemma, when remembering to tail up the scene happened 20 minutes ago."
90,★★★½,LOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPHHHHH
91,★★★★,Watching this felt like I just suffered amnesia from 1/2 of the movie
92,★★★★★,84
93,★★★★,films to watch before you die
94,★★★½,"It was undoubtedly the most narratively-interesting movie of this century, but it walks the line between greatly creative and overly confusing. A confusion certainly necessary for that awesome ending, which I suppose made it worthwhile."
95,★★★★★,Brad Pitt
96,★★★★★,But I just forgot what I was suppose to wr...
97,★★★★,This was a very interesting and unique way to tell a story. Had me at the edge of my seat the entire time once it got going. Loved it! Yes it was my first watch.
98,★★★½,!
99,★★★★½,"By telling the story out of order and backwards, this is easily of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. Definitely worth rewatching in the future."
100,★★★★★,sometimes i think this movie is more important to me than my life
101,★★★★★,Discount Brad Pitt.....
102,★★★★★,"Excellent film, though. Nolan skillfully directs the film in a backward manner, combining elements that have never been done before."
103,Watched by,"this is the best movie ever made. wait, where was i? oh, yeah, this is the best movie ever made."
104,★★★★★,"The strongest Nolan script, I really love when movies with plot twist hold on rewatch like Memento. I really watched this movie so many times so I always can remember everything about it but the movie ends up adding something new on every rewatch. It's great commentary on vengeance, toxic masculinity, lost of identity and some other themes worth exploring is what it makes maybe the strongest Nolan movie. I will never get tired of this movie!"
105,★★★★,"me: no you not... you're not, baby and that's okay! you're not good and you don't need to be good all the time, it's okay to not be good!"
106,★★★★½,"That was excellent. It's going to take a while to put it together in my head, but that's part of the fun of this story told in reverse order. Right? So far I've only seen Nolan's Batman movies, but I think I need to see some more. What an ending (beginning?)!"
107,★★,i Am confusion
108,★★★★★,nolan's best movie and if you disagree.. i'm sorry but you're wrong
109,★★★★,Owie my brain hurt
110,★★★½,"Watching this film unravelling before you is truly great, even if it struggles to justify most of what happens as more than a setup to a twist ending, or to make the characters feel like people."
111,★★★★,Crazyyyyyyyyy
112,★★★★★,Now this is a film I would call perfect. It was even better on rewatch.
113,★★★★½,"With an acute understanding of the post-modernist fixation of noir, Nolan crafts a film that doesn't simply play with memory, it's about memory. The cinematography feels a bit uninspired, but - narratively - this is a masterpiece of a film. I give it a 4.5/5."
114,★★★★★,aye Nolan release Tenet on VOD you coward.
115,★★★★★,Meu filme favorito do Nolan. Super recomendo!
116,★★★★,probably not the best film to watch with a headache
117,★★★★,"Christopher Nolan's breakout film, and a marvel of stylistic gimmickry complimenting thematic content. It's easy to focus on the ingenious backward plot structure, that manages to generate genuine suspense even after it begins at the end of the story. But the real triumph of Memento is how it comments on the nature of memory and the necessary human capacity for self-deception, using the structure to underline the point."
118,★★★★★,"Test this, you fucking quack!"
119,Watched by,"I don't really know what to say here. It's great, but it's just... it's definitely made by Nolan. It fucks around with time and the order of events, and while it's far from a bad experience, it made next to no sense on a first watch. What I could make sense of was great, but I'll definitely be watching this a few more times before I rate and rank it."
120,★★★★★,Nolan's masterpiece
121,★★★★½,", but this is still his most tightly wound. His strongest written piece, and visually his most aesthetically pleasing to date. Hardly a flaw to be found here and its ending still washes over me with such a profound aching sadness that it's hard to revisit on a regular basis."
122,★★★★★,Beautifully told story. Masterful filmmaking.
123,★★★★★,"such an incredible movie from an incredible director, Memento it's one of the most original and unique movies I have ever seen. Also with great performances and great soundtrack, highly recomend."
124,★★★★★,Alright thanks to everyone who got me to 400 followers. And to the 400th follower you know who you are thank you.
125,★★★★★,(Nolan Movie Ranking).
126,★★★★½,"I kneel before thee, Sir. You may hijack my mind anytime."
127,★★★★★,Got chills from the end
128,★★★★★,"I decided to re-watch this on Christmas Eve with my family because my mom wanted to watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and I really didn't want to, so she said ""I bet you can't name a better film"" so I did. this one"
129,★★★★,I am... confused in a great way
130,★★★★½,shit shit shit shit shit shit shit

132,★★★★,I lost interest a bit in the middle but this is a great movie holy shit
133,★★★★½,"is like a puzzle, and I really enjoyed putting it together. However, I need to watch it like 10 times more, in order to fully understand it."
134,★★★★½,you can't spell memento without meme
135,★★★★½,feel.
136,★★★★★,Not liking Memento should be considered a war crime
137,★★★★½,(YO. Just realized the main character has no idea either.)
138,★★★★½,"does work, and it works damn well."
139,★★★★,"this came out when I knew I was too young to understand it so I didn't try, but it's always been on my list. I'm not a Nolan fan historically but this was essentially a bastard love child he had in a 3way with Danny Boyle and Guy Ritchie and that was fine. Irreversible did the backward storytelling better, but what made this interesting was that it never took itself seriously - which I feel is a well suited way to mirror the tone of such an admittedly unreliable narrator."
140,★★★★★,Brilliant. Absolutely fucking brilliant.
141,★★★★,i rewatched this immediately after watching because i sure love having my mind fucked like that
142,★★★★,this was bat shit crazy... i loved it
143,★★★★,"Side Note: This movie reminded me of 'Bloodshot', and if you've seen that movie you'll know what I mean."
144,★★★★½,only 4.5 because guy pearce in this resembles my ex
145,★★★★★,Did somebody say masterpiece?
146,★★★½,"great plot and i've never seen a movie edited or told with this structure so it was really interesting to watch it unravel. defo one of nolan's better films, in my opinion."
147,★★★★★,"Just as Shutter Island, a psychopath who is making his own story for a relief.."
148,★★★★,if Pants is there telling Leo how much he fucked up and what a big idiot he is?
149,★★★★,wait what just happened
150,★★★★½,this film will get the final 1/2 star once i understand what's going on
151,★★★★★,"When we watch a classic Noir, the voiceover narration of its protagonist or witness of the fatal event prepares us for the worst to come at the end. But in the hands of Nolan's brilliant narrative it is at the beginning where the real mystery is to be found, and the true fate that neither its complex protagonist (with a shining Guy Pearce) and neither we will be able to understand or dissect at the end."
152,★★★★½,"Just as good as the last time I watched it, and one of several great films in Nolan's canon."
153,★★★★½,Leonard just deserves a nice breakfast in bed and a kiss on the forehead. I love him
154,★★★★½,Thank you Christopher Nolan! Your movie is great!
155,★★★★½,"My rating of this movie just went up! After not have seen it in years, it was like watching a new movie again. The rewatch value with the movie is insane. Very underrated performance by Guy pierce with so much nuance to the character. A great mystery movie where you can rearrange a lot of the scenes and the film still makes sense. It is a lot to take in for those who are unaware of the movie."
156,★★★★½,"Thanks for the suggestion, @VanillaSky!"
157,★★★★★,Withholding information by telling the story backwards to make the audience experience what the protagonist is going through is hands-down one of the most brilliant forms of storytelling in film history. And that doesn't even begin to explain the depths this film goes to. Hard to believe it's been 20 years since Nolan came out with this masterpiece.
158,★★★★,Christopher Nolan is truly a genius.
159,★★★★½,"""I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different."""
160,★★★★,to the story Nolan was trying to tell.
161,★★★★★,"I figured I'd start catching up on the remaining Nolan films that I have not seen yet. Until I have seen Following, Insomnia, and The Prestige, I am going to say for now that Memento is Nolan's best written film and with no pun intended, I am never going to forget my experience with this film because that ending is going to haunt me as I keep living."
162,★★★★★,I first saw this film too long ago so all I remembered was the basic premise and that it was a mindfuck. The fact that I forgot all about it and was mindfucked again is quite possibly the most ironic thing in history.
163,★★★★½,4.5/5
164,★★★★,"I finally saw ""Memento"" which has been one of my shames for a while. I love how Nolan twists the narrative in a way that you keep guessing. I thought I knew the twist but I was shocked when it came. I want to watch it again because I'm postive it has rewatch value."
165,★★★★★,finding dory type beat
166,★★★★★,It's also one of the first movies that made me fall in love with the possibilities of storytelling but EW ENOUGH ABOUT ME.
167,★★★★,"This is a terrific film with a whole lot of depth, for it to be able to be told backwards makes it even better! Even at the end I was still questioning it, like Ummm what happened ? Even though I thought I knew I didn't know for certain. Overall I'm glad I finally watched this brilliant film in which Guy Pearce gives a great performance in by far his best film. Highly recommend."
168,★★★★★,christopher robin
169,★★★★★,"I have to believe in a world outside my own mind. I have to believe that my actions still have meaning, even if I can't remember them. I have to believe that when my eyes are closed, the world's still there. Do I believe the world's still there? Is it still out there?... Yeah. We all need mirrors to remind ourselves who we are. I'm no different."
170,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan took non-linear film-making to the next level with this movie. Breathtaking cinematography from Wally Pfister and an extraordinary performance from Guy Pearce. The dvd and blu-ray has an easter egg to watch this in chronological order. Backwards or forwards this is one of the greatest movies of recent times.
171,★★★★★,QUE BUENA PELICULA LOCO nolan t amo me voy a tatuar fan #1 d nolan en la frente
172,Watched by,convinced christopher nolan just creates his confusing af storylines just to make us rewatch it a couple times and give him more money
173,★★★★,how do u remember that u forget if ur gonna forget that u forget
174,★★★★½,One of the GREATEST mystery movie ever made. Script and directing style complement each other perfectly. One of Nolan's best works.
175,★★★★½,Next Review: Blinded By The Light
176,★★★★½,"officially back on the nolan train. loved everything about it this time. the standout performance here is carrie anne-moss. if the world was a good place, she would be the biggest star along keanu reeves."
177,★★★★★,@ christopher nolan u amaze me every single time
178,★★★★★,i don't know what happened but i know that i loved it
179,★★★★★,Alabado sea Nolan.
180,★★★★★,"Spectacular, one of those films that don't let you relax for a second, dizzying, full of details, bravo Nolan."
181,★★★½,"Annoying movie, the mystery is not interesting enough to warrant this kind of format, it has no rhythm at all."
182,★★★★,the first fifteen minutes were great but i can't remember anything else :(
183,★★★½,"certainly commendable on being scientifically accurate (at least on what we know so far) about the neurobiology of memory, but once the awe of the nonlinear narrative structure begins to wane, nothing of the film's story remains with you as if the film itself fades like one of Leonard's temporary memories."
184,★★★★½,Still holds much of the same power for me. Mesmerizing cinema from a new filmmaker announcing his presence and intentions. I would say that Nolan definitely lived up to the hype.
185,★★★★½,[Christopher Nolan ranked]
186,★★★★,also fuck natalie!
187,★★★★★,. Brad pitt gives a great performance tho
188,★★★★½,"has made my mind go through an acid trip battle that all I want to do, is go through it again."
189,★★★★★,"I am reeling. Christopher Nolan is a genius. I wish he would go back to directing small-scale stories like this one, not that his massive tales are worse, but I'd love to see a return to form for him. That single moment where Leonard shakes the polaroid and the film shifts from black and white to color gave me goosebumps. It's just a small stroke of pure filmmaking mastery."
190,★★★½,"nope, running away from him"""
191,★★★★★,"""no... he's chasing me"""
192,★★★★½,"I tended to lean towards the ""this is overrated"" camp on this one, but watching it again this time it clicked a little better, I like the way it rides on waves of emotion underneath its gimmicky (but logical and effective!) narrative schematic. I still think it botches Carrie-Anne Moss' character though."
193,★★★★,My brain hurts from all of this
194,★★½,Rating: 44/100
195,★★★,"This movie is actually much better in chronological order (available on the special edition DVD as a hidden extra), which kinda renders the whole reverse-storytelling thing a gimmick. Would be so much better with more focus. Example: get rid of the completely extraneous Dodd sequence and flesh out the actual characters and their relationships and motivations a bit more instead of pissing around with dumb filler."
196,Watched by,I stayed up till 3 am last night working on a Donda piece then I woke up at 9 am and continued to work on it all day. I'm exhausted and my desk looks like a kitchen but it is done! so now I am gonna kick back and watch this as my reward and then I will post it an hour or two before the event starts and finally get some proper sleep!
197,★★★★½,Wow... this film is truly something else! Memento demands multiple viewings in order to fully appreciate the unique and original structure and narrative. Love how Christopher Nolan challenges us intellectually and makes us become an active participant even though we feel disoriented because of the non-linear structure. Makes us feel like we have Leonard's condition.
198,★★★★★,literally one of the best movies ever

207,★★,"Early on, before they revealed the backstory behind his tattoos, I was a massive subscriber to the theory that Carrie-Ann Moss & Joe Pantoliano found Guy Pearce unconscious after the inciting incident & effectively vandalized his body, getting him tatted with random pointless bullshit and scribbling on him with aimless instructions & facts & conspiracies just to fuck with him"

209,★★★★★,THIS FILM IS SO CLEVER I CANT GET OVER IT. I LOVE THIS FILM OH MY.
210,★★★★½,"Last seen more than 10 years ago, this one aged quiet a bit. Anyway still the ground solid narrative one trick pony with minimalistic style and a sweet flow. I did forget how much Nolan was (and still is) into pure Genre Cinema."
211,★★★★★,"I remember being absolutely floored by this movie after initially seeing it, but after several years of distance and being even more amazed at Nolan's subsequent work, I wondered if this movie would still work, knowing the outcome. I'd dare say this I enjoyed this movie even more the second time, mostly on account of Guy Pearce's amazingly sarcastic, droll, wiseass performance. I find it unbelievable that he has yet to be nominated for an Oscar, as he has repeatedly pulled out one incredible performance after another."

229,★★★★,it's embarrassing how much brain power it took for me to follow this plot
230,★★★★★,10/10
231,★★★★½,Bruh
232,★★★★★,"If Nolan can pull time off in 'Tenet' half as good he does in this, we will have a true masterpiece on our hands"
233,★★★★★,"Memento is certainly an odd movie, but damn was is it ever amazing. Easily Christopher Nolan's best movie in my opinion."
234,★★★★,Has anyone ever done their brother a solid as much as this getting nominated for Best Screenplay? Because I doubt it
235,★★★★★,David Julyan > Hans Zimmer
236,★★★½,Forgot this movie and had to be sure I saw it before
237,★★★★★,"-search ""Memento explained"" on youtube-"
238,★★★★★,is my first review.
239,★★★★,"Honestly, I just feel bad for the editor."
240,★★★★,My brain is literally noodles
241,★★★★★,"its literally PERFECT (to me, despite some teeny tiny issues). i loved it a lot. one of my favourites from Nolan now."
242,★★★★½,also I wonder what this movie would be like if someone edited it in reverse so we could see everything happen chronologically
243,★★★★½,"Love the twist, love how Nolan managed to incorporate the non-linear structure without it seeming gimmicky, where it actually makes sense to the narrative. Very interesting movie. Would love to rewatch soon."
244,★★★★,.look best Pearce's Guy be gotta has This
245,★★★★★,basically the most original movie i've ever seen
246,★★★★,probably some of the most impressively detailed writing ever. mathematical precision.
247,Rewatched by,i hadn't watched this in so long that i completely forgot how the ending went so it's fair to say that mr. nolan has fucked my mind yet again. i think he's one of the few directors around where you could argue between like 5 of his movies as to which one is considered his masterpiece. christopher is just that powerful
248,★★★½,I didn't really find it terribly compelling though? Lenny has like zero personality and I could only ever be invested in his story to the point of getting the answers not because I really cared about him getting whatever he needed out of it.
249,★★★★★,I have no fucking clue what just happened but all i know is that i really loved this film. I love getting mind fucked by Christopher Nolan yikes.
250,★★★★½,I was confused the whole way through and I loved it.
251,★★★★★,Nolan's most BIG BRAIN film! This is his most poggers film. The best mystery easily. Irreversible compared to this is basically a 1/10. Nolan's other film's compared to this are basically worst than The Room. Easy 10! One of the most unpredictable movies ever made! I've seen it 5 times and it's still extremely entertaining! Also I forgot how great the score was for this!
252,★★★★½,My brain is absolutely fried but very good movie
253,★★★★,Nolan's most emotional movie and that's why it's still good even though I'm over these mindfuck movies.
254,★★★★★,Went into this movie completely blind and was floored. What a puzzling film in the best way.
255,★★★★,christopher nolan always has me on google the second after i finish one of his movies looking for the ending explained
256,★★★★,nolan machista sempre matando as esposas dos protagonistas
257,★★★★,if my life was like this I'd simply give up lol
258,★★★★★,loved everything understood nothing
259,★★★★,the premise of this film and the way it's told is so unique i love it. it's absolutely amazing to me that someone could come up with this concept.
260,★★★,i wish i was smarter
261,★★★★,it's a such interesting movie with a great screenplay.
262,★★★★,My brain is broken. Seeing Ralphie from Sopranos pop up in this just made me remember how much of a shit he was ngl
263,★★★★,"masterfully made, just like all Nolan films, but deep down, this is nothing but a twisted mystery/thriller film. i was expecting a lil more - i only really started loving Memento in its last 45 minutes, and the ending was haunting. not the strongest 8/10 tho"
264,★★★★,i understood everything ?? am i SMART ????
265,★★★★,"Let me ask you this. Do you lie to other people to avoid the pain of knowing the truth? And, do you lie to yourself, and believe something that is not true, just to make yourself be happy for a brief moment?"
266,★★★★½,the fucking effort that the editing team put into this......i could cry
267,★★★★★,movie a of masterpiece fucking A.
268,★★★★★,Christopher fucking Nolan stop playing with my fucking brain!
269,Rewatched by,Nolan's structural work is insanely effective and deeply tragic. Grief eternally haunts without time to guide it away. His emotions are so inventively intertwined with the messing of structure and perception. With the bone-deep need to stare into our guilt and heal.
270,Watched by,this nolan guy is pretty good
271,★★★★★,"Please Hollywood, don't remake it!"
272,★★★★,"Like Inception except this is MORE mind-bending, Memento plays with your mind crazy and you have to keep your eyes glued and ears wide open in order to get it, you cannot miss one bit of the movie especially the very beginning. This was Christopher Nolan's second film of his career and just a great unique & clever film. One of those rare films that goes backwards and goes forward as the movie goes on and it's effective."
273,★★★★★,damn he has good handwriting
274,★★★★,these matrix sequels are getting crazy man.... also i loved when people pointed out leonard's designer suit as if he wasn't cosplaying walter white for most of the movie
275,★★★★,i may be confused but i already know this is gonna SLAP on a rewatch
276,★★★★½,"This film is amazing and fucks with your mind, memento is better then inception !"
277,★★★★,props to the editing team! this must've been such a pain in the ass to edit
278,★★★★,this movie is actually about me when i get too high and have to leave reminders for myself in my notes app
279,★★★★,"have been meaning to watch this for years and kept putting it off because the subject matter was so uncomfortable, until me and my bf started watching a b99 episode earlier that kept referencing memento and i refused to get spoilers... so we stayed up till 5:30 watching this just so we could finish the last 10 or so minutes of the episode"
280,★★★★½,tell me why i thought brad pitt was in this film not guy pearce
281,★★★★½,el final
282,★★★★,tattoo:watch memento
283,★★★★,I HATE U CHRISTOPHER NOLAN SO MUCH JUST MAKE A NORMAL STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVIE I BEG OF YOU
284,★★★★★,my roommate was watching this for the first time and i loved watching his reactions throughout the whole movie
285,★★★★★,another Nolan masterpiece!!!!!!!!!
286,★★★★★,Score: 10/10
287,★★★★½,"Well Done, Christopher Nolan."
288,★★★★½,What the fuck.
289,★★★★,LOVE the screenplay.
290,★★★★★,One of the most well crafted films of all time. I can't believe that it works as well as it does. It's a movie that requires you to pay attention and to use your brain to follow the story. I wish I could make a movie this good one day.
291,★★★½,"One of Nolan's first film that is both a cleverly made and unconventional thriller and acts as a good introduction to his style, recurring themes and motifs that would be find in the rest of his filmography. Not my favorite in Nolan's excellent filmography so far but still very good."
292,★★★★,and i love it
293,★★★★★,[[DO NOT BELIEVE HIS LIES]]
294,★★★★½,youtu.be/eyK7T-7vCro
295,★★★★,why is there a tattoo on my chest that says i got pregnant from watching this???
296,★★★,christopher nolan: so how can i make this next scene even more CONFUSING as fucking possible........
297,★★★★★,This film is a masterpiece
298,★★★★★,Easy 5 stars. I like Christopher Nolan a lot and Memento is easily some of his best work. This and Inception are my favorites of his. Probably Guy Pearce's best role. Great non-linear story telling with enough layers to warrant many rewatches.
299,★★★★★,"Memento is a truly original, exciting, and gripping neo-noir psychological thriller from writer/director Christopher Nolan, with fantastic performances, terrific direction, and engaging characters."
300,★★★★½,I haven't seen this in years and it held up very well.
301,★★★★★,Classic.
302,★★★★,"Christopher Nolan, please just have sex with a clock and get this obsession with time over with."
303,★★★★,"other than that, pretty good. i have a massive headache :)"
304,★★★★★,I miss the good old days when Christopher Nolan used the f-word
305,★★★★★,"Man, I can't wait for the remake!"
306,★★★★★,Now where was I?
307,★★★★★,genuis strategic a is Batman Nolan's
308,★★★★★,"my sister came into the room, said ""wow, he's attractive!"" and left. she didn't lie."
309,★★★★,Final Verdict: B
310,★★★★½,every character in this film looks like a combination of at least 3 inglourious basterds characters
311,★★★★½,what the actual fuck!!! i feel like this gave ME a brain injury just trying to understand wtf just happened
312,★★★★★,I would love to see someone try and make a film like this today cause this movie is truley one of a kind
313,★★★,i hate you christopher nolan i hate you so much
314,★★★★½,that opening scene w the inversion was a tenet tease but 20 years early
315,★,"Ugly in its insincerity; speaks of the poetry of certainties and details we take for granted and the range of emotions in Pearce's Lenny, then hardens details into events, pieces to be solved, and treats people as objects. Makes me nauseous."
316,★★★★★,this movie just became one of my favorites of all time
317,★★★★★,"Very strange that I hadn't seen this but finally got around to it! Was literally everything I wanted it to be! Incredible performances from all of the cast, specifically Guy Pearce. He seriously played his character to perfection, never feeling unbelievable in a single scene. The order in which the film takes place is totally bonkers and absolutely broke my brain. Also, the ending is just TOO good to deny. Loved it a lot, will definitely be watching it again soon!"
318,★★★★½,ralphie cannot be trusted
319,★★★½,slightly confusing but enjoyable nonetheless
320,★★★★½,"pulls it off with ease thanks to Christopher Nolan and his meticulous storytelling. Despite the number of times I've watched this movie over the years, the puzzle always remains a captivating and fresh experience."
321,★★★★★,"The way this movie is structured, just might be genius."
322,★★★★½,Nolan never disappoints
323,★★★★★,My brain hurts.
324,★★★★½,You know it's a Nolan movie when your brain is in a fucking knot afterwards
325,★★★★,2000 Films Ranked
326,★★★★★,"Hot take: What happened to THIS guy? The director of Memento and The Prestige? Tightly controlled worlds, little puzzle boxes. I know you're ""supposed"" to keep making big budget pictures while you can, because the opportunities are fleeting, but it's been 20 years. It's a great career. Make a ""little gem"" again, Mr. Nolan. Those will outlast the Interstellars-DKRs of history."
327,★★★★,i need to ...sit down
328,★★★★½,memento we are getting you back from filmbros
329,★★★★,Okay... Christopher Nolan did that...
330,★★★★★,"It had been so many years since I saw this, that it really was like I was witnessing it all over again for the very first time. That just made this rewatch really something so rewarding and even legitimately surprising. Nolan always knows how to get inside my head apparently."
331,★★★★½,christopher edward nolan: you never specified how MUCH closure so...
332,★★★★★,"Its about time I re-watched one of my favorite films of all time. Memento is my favorite Christopher Nolan film as well. In his second outing as director, Nolan continues to show off his nonlinear story telling style. This movie not only makes you want to watch it again, but requires you to with its plot made complex by subjecting you to the point of view of the protagonist who lives without short term memory. Memento is the best example in Nolan's excellent filmography of how he refuses to pander to the masses."
333,★★★★,The story is about a man who has no long term memory tries to piece together his life and finds things are not as they seem. This movie has really clever writing and great acting.
334,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan Ranked
335,★★★★½,.
336,★★★★,me: alright time to go on reddit
337,★★★★★,"Was soll ich nur sagen, dieser Film ist einfach immer wieder ein Genuss und ganz zu Recht heute bereits Kult."
338,★★★★,spent so much of this viewing experience crippled by the thought of how easily a person in this situation would be taken advantage of and how scared i am of this happening to me!!! anyway i already need to rewatch this. if i was leonard i would simply have created a note on my iphone
339,★★★½,"Crazy lenny... Cool but I think I wasn't in the mood so 3.5/5... I promise, I will rewatch this film!.. Bajingan jadi semua kemumetan ini demi kepuasan pribadinya si nganu. Kaga waras si ni orang wkwk.. Inget gaes, jangan ngantuk pas nonton ini. Kudu konsen lho..."
340,★★★★½,"This just hit me in the head, and now I got this condition. I've told you this before, haven't I? Because, this slaps! From 2.5 this is now 4.5. Love that feeling. Wait, I need to take a screenshot in case my memory fades."
341,★★★★★,Lactose intolerance is a bithc
342,★★★★★,Guy Pearce is hot
343,★★★★★,"It's strange, idk why but this morning when i woke up it seems that i've written on my hands to edit the movie file in reverse order"
344,★★★★½,how does someone just like come up with this idea one day i literally cannot comprehend this
345,★★★★½,p.s.s. i readily obliged her tho
346,★★★★★,this film + 3 cups of coffee = the worst possible headache you could imagine
347,★★★★½,Name every memory

355,Rewatched by,DVD
356,★★★★½,"A unique thriller with an interesting chronologically-backwards narrative that initially seems gimmicky, but it makes a lot of sense for the slow-burning story and the interesting twist ending that may give you more questions than answers, but they're questions and implications that are fun to think about and make your own conclusions to."
357,★★★★★,The sister's bf is almost as bad as her when it comes to eluding such masterful works of cinema like this one. I'm certainly glad to have this blindspot of his rectified.
358,★★★★,short term memory loss seems like fun
359,★★★★½,I FINALLY FIND THE MASTERPIECE OF NOLAN
360,★★★★½,"Happy 15th Birthday, man!"
361,★★★½,i love this movie. would love to understand it someday
362,★★★★,It's really good. I like how Nolan plays with time and gives the audience something to think about. Pretty smart. The story itself isn't the most interesting but I do enjoy this film quite a bit.
363,★★★★★,"*Manny takes a Polaroid picture of Donald Trump and shakes it as Outkast told him many moons ago in the song' ""Hey Ya!"". As the photo develops he writes on the back, ""Don't Believe His LIES."" He puts the picture back in his pocket and dyes his hair bleach blonde to look as cool as Guy Pearce.*"
364,★★★★★,I've seen this movie so many times and I always think I know everything that happens but then I watch it again and some shit I have absolutely no recollection of shows up and blows my mind and I gotta rethink my entire life again.
365,★★★★½,"This is one of the greatest Thrillers I've ever seen. Even without the ambitious storytelling method, the characters and what they go through is so well written. Now I really want to see a version edited in chronological order."
366,★★★★½,i'm going to convince myself that i understood what happened in this movie
367,★★★★★,"I can't believe it took me so long to finally watch this. I was completely hooked and even though I had accidentally seen spoilers for the end, I still enjoyed the journey getting there and the revelation was incredible."
368,★★★★★,"Christopher Nolan uses a fractured narrative to tell an interesting story and create a modern masterpiece. A literal brainteaser that forces the viewer to watch multiple times to truly comprehend what they've witnessed and find something new each time. Absorbing, complex, heartbreaking, thrilling, inventive, and terrific neo-noir."
369,★★★★★,this live action of finding dory is amazing
370,★★★★½,"Visiting this movie after almost 4 years, gaining a lot of perspective between that time and I have to say Nolan is still a genius, the context with which I might've said earlier would've been different but the sentiment is pretty much the same. Still holds up brilliantly after all these years, much more tightly structured than I remember it to be and a lot more nuanced than I expected. Maybe my dispassion towards Nolan these past few years have been unfounded after all."
371,★★★★½,BRUH THE ENDING IS NUTS the way it connects and lying to yourself and omg that ending
372,★★★★★,polaroids and stick 'n' pokes? leonard is a hipster piece of shit. #outed
373,★★★★½,"Memento is brilliantly complex - the use of narrative and non-linear plot, the slow unravelling of the events, the use of contrasting black and white and full colour sequences to tell different intertwining plots - everything about it is so original and intriguing. Guy Pearce is brilliant, I haven't enjoyed any of his recent roles but now that I've seen this I definitely think a lot more of him."
374,★★★★½,gaslighting: the movie
375,★★★★½,the writing really immerses the audience into what the main character is feeling in such a seamless way
376,★★★★,I'm sorry for everything bad I've ever said about Ending Explained video essays.
377,★★★★½,I feel like this gets better with every rewatch. So good.
378,★★★★½,god christopher nolan you really love making me feel stupid until the last 5 minutes of your movies
379,★★★★,fucking david fincher .........
380,★★★½,Was like a first time watch as it seems my long term memory has gone for this film. Both a hypnotic and frustrating film as Nolan again puzzles his audience with the non-linear time frame. It's a hell of ride while watching though.
381,★★★★★,Nolan ranked
382,★★★★,"I also very much enjoy Guy Pearce in the lead role. And it's just such a fun, intriguing movie that doesn't feel like it's doing too much. I can only imagine it'll grow on me in the coming weeks."
383,★★★★½,Nolan was like what if I made one massively poggers film and then just never did it again
384,★★★★★,i just found my new favourite nolan movie. holy shit
385,★★★★★,Do I lie to myself to be happy?
386,★★★★½,chris nolan's hairpin explanation for this film is genius i am in awe of this man
387,★★★★★,FKSLDKCSMDJWJD I WANNA SCREAM
388,★★★★,So many early Nolan-isms.
389,Watched by,i have no idea what was going on in this movie i feel so stupid
390,★★★★½,"time to watch this again in the future, but I regret waiting so long to watch this. Nolan never misses."
391,★★★½,"-Joe, giving me a bloody nose after I said this felt kinda slow"
392,★★★★½,"Memento is an absolute mind-bender. Even after multiple viewings I still am not certain as to what actually happened. Nevertheless, the story is told is such a unique and compelling way that it keeps you glued to the screen the entire time. Christopher Nolan's story would have been interesting enough told in a straightforward way, but telling it backwards & forwards at the same time was as stroke of genius."
393,Watched by,Should I watch this in reverse or?
394,★★★★,"Thriller atrapante, gran actuacion de Guy Pearce, geniales planos de Nolan en blanco y negro su direccion siempre Masterpiece."
395,★★★★★,"Also Happy Chapman from Garfield The Movie is in this, so what's not to love."
396,★★★★★,I think Nolan should do a small budget film again. His budgets and concepts keep growing and are starting to overshadow his characters. His characters are just turning into plot devices. Just my humble opinion.
397,★★,is this what the heterosexuals on reddit masturbate to
398,★★★½,in order for me to PERFECTLY understand a Nolan film in just the first viewing? seriously what? asking for a friend (and myself)....
399,★★★★,"I was stressed tf out, it has gotten to the point where I felt like I wanted to find out the truth more than Leonard himself, and honestly, this movie is the reason why I have trust issues."
400,★★★★½,"I had a great idea for a review, but then I forgot it :("
401,★★★★½,"cinematic gold, nolan does it once again. i can't emphasize enough the genius of his filmmaking. truly, his best film."
402,★★★★½,It introduced me to the idea of subjective memory and therefore subjective truth. It may be flawed - running a little ragged in the middle - but that profound idea always strikes a chord for me.
403,★★★★½,Not a film that is well served by reviewing and I'm probably the last person in the world to see it anyway. It's excellent. You knew that.
404,★★★★½,"A third, reluctant viewing ended up being the ticket to me finally loving this film. Feel free to mock me for how wrong I was all this time"
405,★★★★★,"Most probably my favorite movie ever. Nolan plays with the plot like a modern Homer, Guy Pearce travels through his memories like a modern Ulysses and after the movie ends, like Kavafis ""Ithaca"", you are full of questions but you feel clean - just like after an ancient greek tragedy."
406,★★★★,film number 200 of the year!!
407,★★★,"LOL ""Meme""nto"
