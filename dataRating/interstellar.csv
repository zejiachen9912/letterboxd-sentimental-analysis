1,★★★★★,tell me you wouldn't cry too if your son grows up to be casey affleck
2,★★★★★,"I'm pretty sure no one will EVER come close to being as talented as Hans Zimmer is, also I would kill 10 people just to see this in theaters."
3,★★★★,When those Zimmer organs kick in *biggest possible chef's kiss*
4,★★★★★,i needed a REALLY good cry
5,★★★★★,HOLY SHIT I AM REALLY NOT OKAY WITH BEING ALIVE RIGHT NOW
6,★★★★½,you know youre #FAMOUS when just the fact that you're randomly in the movie is the Big Twist (@mattdamon)
7,★★★★,watched on my 13 inch macbook air just as christopher nolan intended <3
8,★★★★★,JESSICA CHASTAIN SAVED US ALL
9,★★★★½,(she also happened to be my mom)
10,★★★★,christopher nolan should make a superhero movie. imagine how good that would be
11,★★★★★,hahahaha the main menu came on and i started crying what the fuck why is this the saddest movie to ever exist
12,★★★★★,A visionary achievement that I will cherish until I settle down for the long nap.
13,★★★★★,i hate to sound like a cheesy old white lady but that shit is breathtaking bro

15,★★★★½,fuck you matthew mcconaughey for making me cry
16,★★★★,And half stupid ass bumbfuck ending dumbass stupid ass what the dumb halo ring human life bull bdkrkfigi
17,★★★★★,this planet were going to be around long enough for jessica chastain to figure out a way to get us all the fuck off of it
18,★★★★★,the best film of the 2010s
19,★★★★½,"Nolan's protagonists have always been obsessed explorers of one form or another. Somehow I don't think I realized until now just how much they're driven by loss, battling the universe's unbending laws forbidding the undoing of a past trauma or mistake."
20,★★★★★,.
21,★★★★★,"Time and space, quantifiable love, the 4th dimension - Nolan's masterpiece and one of the best films of the decade; montage/crosscutting that makes you believe there is, again since the renaissance, a true link between art and science. It reminds me of Jia Zhangke's notes on Godard, Tarkovsky and Eisenstein: that the former two did not go as far as Eisenstein because they only studied art and politics, but failed to study physics and chemistry."
22,★★★,Why did they have to go and ruin what could have been a great film!
23,Watched by,"After watching this film, you will want to downgrade all of the ratings you have ever given on Letterboxd."
24,★★★★★,"obviously, all clashing with nolan's cold precision and construction that attempts to turn scientific theory and very basic existential and emotional ideas of generational mortality into something not just physically tangible but physically achievable. ultimately makes this kind of feel like watching a weird, sad robot man try to algorithmically process the value of humans as deeply frail and emotional beings, which is dramatically misguided maybe but so conceptually moving i can't help but get swept up in it. i feel every corny second of this thing."
25,★★,remember how nasa asked sally ride if 100 tampons was enough for one week in space? anne hathaway goes for like two minutes tops and she wants to fuckin go to planet whatever to chase after a dude she banged ten years ago because women are guided by their emotions and love is all you need
26,★★,e) All of the above.
27,★★★★,"""Fu-gay-zee, fugazi, it's a wozzy it's a woozy."""
28,★★★★½,how dare this fucking movie make me cry... TWICE
29,★★★,"So good in its best sequences, so immensely flawed, over-explained, nonsensical, or insulting in others."
30,★★★★★,ZOOP! THIS MOVIE RUINED MY LIFE
31,★★★★½,Still don't like Inception though
32,★★★★½,stans where you at???
33,★★★★★,my wig flew and is currently orbiting every far corner of space and time with mr mcconaughey
34,★★½,It is two and half hours of show and tell I will not put myself through again.
35,★★★★★,The great (unintentional) running joke in Interstellar? It's all about fixing problems with GRAVITY. It succeeds.
36,★★★★,The most jaw dropping part of this is still when Matt Damon shows up
37,★★½,"Favorite laughable non-spoiler moment: when it turns out there is a dry erase board on the reverse side of a monitor on the spaceship, useful for diagramming ways to avoid black holes."
38,★★½,www.larsenonfilm.com/interstellar
39,★★★★,"Trotzdem kam heute seltsamerweise ein ""Like-Stern"" hinzu."
40,★★★★★,"gshsbdvsv as we were leaving the theatre this guy goes ""one hour of a christopher nolan movie is four years of real time"""
41,★★★★★,science-fiction is the best thing ever
42,★★★★★,so much with a movie
43,★★★★½,Patreon
44,★★★★★,"This was not the case, because I was once again left sitting in the theater completely amazed and not knowing what to do or say (for the most part). But I'm not complaining."
45,★★★★½,*new word?
46,★★★★★,Where do I put all the tears I've been choking on for the past hour.
47,★★½,2001: A Space Odyssey with an audio commentary track you can't turn off
48,★★★★½,I WILL NEVER TRUST MATT DAMON FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE. FUCK MATT DAMON !!!
49,★★★½,In space every one can hear your love
50,★★★★★,"(also: thank you all for 4,000 followers! it really means a lot <3)"
51,★★★★★,before the end credits even rolled.
52,★★★★★,"hello my name is sree and my hobbies include crying, sobbing, weeping... oh and bawling"
53,★★★★★,"when the gates of heaven start opening, this soundtrack starts playing"
54,★★★★★,"."""
55,★★★★★,"Inception is still his masterpiece but still, this is easily one of the greatest sci-feats i've seen. Thank you once again, Christopher. You're MAGNIFICENT!"
56,★★★★½,"Better than I remember, idk why but I reaaally enjoyed it this time."
57,★★★★½,"matthew mcconaughey was indeed that astronaut in the ocean, rolling down the in deep"
58,★★,I would rather snorkel on the giant wave planet than watch this movie ever again
59,Rewatched by,tars
60,★★★★★,he was her fuckign ghost
61,★★★★½,Most visceral/exciting theater-going experience I've had in maybe ever. IMAX or nothing. Adored Zimmer's score. Loved it.
62,★★★★★,ebiri.blogspot.com/2014/12/interstellar-loneliest-journey-in-human.html
63,★★★★½,after watching this 3 hours film i know exactly how they felt on that water planet
64,★★★★★,sometimes i really do wonder if there is ever going to be another film like this
65,★★★★★,Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.
66,★★★★,Christopher Nolan is a modern cinematic genius.
67,★★★★★,Nope. Still a masterpiece.
68,★★★★★,"Interstellar is a grand experience. It's about family, selflessness, sacrifice, the amazing vastness of time and space. Christopher Nolan has on his hands perhaps the third perfect film in his belt, which is incredible considering he should be making movies for years to come, with permission to do whatever he wants, hopefully we can get more stories that explore the existence of humanity, really make us think reasonably and logically about what's next. Overall, Interstellar is one of those masterpieces that only gets better as time goes by and shall be remembered with generations to come."
69,★★★★★,my eyes are WET
70,★★★★★,"no words, apart from christopher nolan is the best working director alive today."
71,★★★★★,i fell asleep like 6 times
72,★★★★★,and it still has the same astounding impact it had on me upon my first time witnessing it in the theater last November. One of my all-time favorite experiences with a film. I love every second of this beautiful creation.
73,★★★★★,i sad
74,★★★★,.
75,★★★★★,"this is definitely one of my favorite films ever, and who knows, in time it might even become my absolute favorite"
76,★★★★½,it's pretty crazy how jessica chastain sacrificed herself for our sins
77,★★★★½,"Alright, astronauts"
78,★★★★★,yet another movie that reinforces the idea that jessica chastain is the only one who can save the world and that matt damon should be just left in space
79,★★★★½,"Really great, liked it more than I remember."
80,★★★★½,"""I hate space travel. Everyone gets older, I stay the same age."""
81,★★★★★,"Equal parts science lesson, metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and emotional manipulation. I loved it."
82,★★★★★,i hope christopher nolan and hans zimmer are having a good day.
83,★★★★★,10/10
84,★★★,screencrush.com/see-interstellar-on-film/
85,★★★★★,Matthew thanks for making me cry my eyes out.
86,★★★★,it seems that one of my newfound favourite hobbies is translating Michael Caine's lines from this film into English
87,★★★★½,heartbreak and pain kick in from these lines!!!!!!! here we fucking go !
88,★★★★½,"I think what Christopher Nolan was trying to say with Interstellar is simple: You either die a Timothee Chalamet, or you live long enough to see yourself become the Casey Affleck"
89,★★★★½,of Man out of time.
90,★★★½,this is probably the fastest i've ever realized i'm too dumb to understand a movie
91,★★★★★,"for some reason i never got round to watching this, and i can say that not having experienced the transcendent beauty of this film until now is one of biggest regrets. it breaks and rebuilds your heart in the most unique way and i was completely hypnotised, so to the other 2-5 people in the world who haven't seen it, PLEASE WATCH PLEASE"
92,★★★★,"is a hugely ambitious sci-fi film from Nolan that doesn't disappoint. An emotional narrative with spectacularly stunning visuals, even if the story is slightly convoluted. This one takes us to infinity and beyond."
93,★★★★,"Oh, and Casey Affleck's there. Sometimes."
94,★★★★½,We need more movies like Interstellar.
95,★★★★½,The video message scene will never not make me bawl my eyes out. WHAT A MOMENT!!
96,★★★★★,PERFECT IN EVERY WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
97,★★★★,oh and I also got a 70mm imax film print of Jessica Chastain that came with my bluray...who could ask for more
98,★★★★½,"Remarkably intelligent and undeniably ambitious, Christopher Nolan finds the perfect balance of space thrills and human emotion in the truly brilliant Interstellar."
99,★★★½,That one time where Matt Damon is the most unlikeable character in the movie.
100,★★★★★,Endlessly viewable. Always gets me in the feels. What an ensemble.
101,★★★,Nolan
102,★★★★,3. Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's most complete film to date.
103,★★★½,Still good though.
104,★★★★½,It's such a film where I have nothing to complain about.
105,★★★★½,Nolan Ranked
106,★★★,still stand.)
107,★★★★½,"Interstellar is definitely the most ambitious movie of the 2010s, which doesn't have to mean that it's perfect, there are parts of it that I'm still not sure make a hundred percent sense. Despite this, it is so well done in all its technical components and is so emotionally satisfying that there is no denying its position as a classic of modern cinema."
108,★★★★★,A monumental achievement in every department.
109,★★★★★,Interstellar (2014) Changed My Life?!?!! *NOT CLICKBAIT*
110,★★★★½,"The Nolan brothers are both extremely talented men in both story telling and visual art. I watched this movie without knowing much about it, I loved the story and the characters in this movie. Great movie but i know i cant wrap my head around the entire movie. But its a must a see!"
111,★★★★★,forgot how this stupid ass space movie ruined my life why would you people do this why why why
112,★★★★★,I MIGHT GO INTERSTELLAR I FEEL LIKE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY! EVERYBODY SAY THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!
113,★★★★★,p.s i too would wait for u matthew mcconaughey <3333
114,★★★★★,Many tears were shed
115,★★★★★,"Preachier than I remember, particularly in the beginning during the world building, but still emotionally powerful and visually stunning. Carried heavily by one of my favorite soundtracks of the past several years."
116,★★★★½,Reevaluation: this rules so hard.
117,★★★★★,"i'll never forget watching this for the first time, at the cinema with my dad. when the credits rolled i was sobbing, distraught, and he went ""people kept unwrapping their sweets loudly, didn't they?"""
118,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan is a chad.
119,★★★★★,"me, weeping: oh my god.........i'm having feelings again. like some kind of fourteen year old kid. you remember feelings, right?"
120,★★★★★,And let's not forget TARS. Because TARS should be worshipped.
121,★★★★½,Nothing gets me believing in the power of cinema quite so much as when Nolan (and Lee Smith) edit the climaxes of two storylines together to knock me flat on my back.
122,★★★★½,space and time absolutely terrifies me so this was pretty much almost 3 hours of my stomach doing flips but GOD was that last act worth it !!!
123,★★★★★,do you just cry even when it's not time to cry yet because you just know what it's all about and you know it's been him since the beginning and he's gonna save the world and it's tears all over the place even before the movie starts or are you normal?
124,★★½,14 hours into interstellar and cry and you still got 44 minutes left
125,★★★★½,when anne hathaway turns her head away and sighs when michael caine recites that damn dylan thomas poem again #same
126,★★★★★,The accelerationist-masterpiece mindfuck of the 21st Century
127,★★★★½,"Christopher Nolan has this habit of making me think too much. Entertainment shouldn't be quite this complicated, but after the labyrinthian complexity of Inception, this film ups the ante to head-scratching proportions that has left me questioning my intelligence after most of it went over my head. I bet Stephen Hawking loved this. It's bold, brave, mind-boggling and at times bum-numbing, but the visionary imagination on view here is just that. Visually impressive, emotionally engaging, this is a science fiction epic that could prove to be a game changer."
128,Watched by,". Nolan just doesn't think much of his audience, preferring to have characters literally spell out the themes and detail scientific concepts. It's no surprise this movie is a total failure at evoking any emotional response; it's as warm and inviting as a dentist's office."
129,★★★★★,is breathtaking and heartbreaking. It gets better after each viewing. One of the best sci fi movies of the past decade.
130,★★★★★,"Wow, just fucking wow."
131,★★★★★,that was such an unforgettable experience
132,★★★★,"A beautiful work. Ambitious and bold and original. The best live action big budget film I've seen all year. Too much (and too poorly written) dialogue in places where no words would have been a better choice, but so be it."
133,★★★★★,Current Favorites
134,★★★★,Yea.... I totally did not cry
135,Watched by,is like a really beautiful man that you're inclined to fall for but then you notice he can't spell and that changes everything.
136,★★,The true universal constant is Nolan's love for boring realism.
137,★★★★,75/100
138,★★★★,"is upon us I guess it's time for me to revisit some Nolan before I see his newest venture. The visuals are absolutely spectacular, easily Nolan's most visually interesting film. It has a lot of heart to it and really makes for one hell of an experience, even just by watching it on a computer I still had the same feeling that I had back in 2014."
139,★★★★★,Happy 1 hour anniversary
140,★★★★½,this movie is cool. chris nolan makes cool films. things get pretty silly at the end of this but whatever it didnt really bother me. i really like the way the robots look in this.
141,★★★★★,3 hours of coop loving his daughter and giving absolutely zero fucks about his son
142,★★★★,BUT THEN...you have most of Nolan's dialogue be a bunch of exposition and a really bad Matt Damon appearance.
143,★★★★★,"My amazement for this film never ceases to grow. One quick thing I picked up on after countless days of thinking about it is not just its metaphor for life, or love but rather in death too, letting that love prosper. We leave the world for our descendants as we enter the next world. Our new home. But our impact and our presence. The love we shared. Transcends time."
144,★★★★★,Bye
145,★★★★½,interstellar takes place in 2021.
146,★★★★,"""Best Films Of The 10's"""
147,★★★★½,"Yes, I'm absolutely certain of that now."
148,★★★★,"before that, Nolan and co. has delivered another one of the most breathtakingly spectacular films so far this century."
149,★★★★,*puts dunce cap back on*
150,★★★★★,"is truly one of the most beautiful (and confusing) films ever made and i cannot wait to watch this over and over again. i get the nolan hype train now and holy shit, christopher nolan really is a force to be reckoned with."
151,★★★★★,i still cry everytime i watch this movie
152,★★★★,imagine timothee chalamet growing up to be casey affleck haha lmao
153,★★★★½,"""Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here."""
154,★★★★★,Makes me bawl like a baby
155,★★★★½,I seriously pity people who don't even try to enjoy Nolan movies just because he is so popular. They have NO idea what they are missing.
156,★★★★★,also i know its spooky szn and all that jazz so i need to up my game and start watching some scary shiz
157,★★★★½,"I hadn't seen this since its theatrical release, and I'm happy to say that my initial lukewarm read was wrong. This movie FUCKS."
158,★★★,"I think Nolan's movies are okay to look at, I mean, they certainly are pretty. There were some nice space shots in this one but everything just felt very clinical and pristine. Not a lot of emotion in it. At least, I didn't feel it."
159,★★★★,Those times where you wish you had a secret door in your bookshelf
160,★★★★★,"Still, I loved Interstellar."
161,★★★★,"This film really blows its true potential, but I'm willing to forgive most of it because the water planet sequence and its aftermath are so awesome and profound and one of my favorite sequences in film."
162,★★★★★,best movie of all time i think
163,★★★★,THE TARS MY DESTINATION
164,★★★★★,Wow really 0/3 on that one Carrie
165,★★★★½,"Visually arresting, thought-provoking, and emotionally-charged, ""Interstellar"" is a time-bending, wholly immersive cinematic experience that had me floored from the first frame."
166,★★★★★,THIS WILL NEVER GET OLD CHRISTOPHER NOLAN YOUR A GENUIS
167,★★★★★,the interstellar soundtrack could get me through anything
168,★★★★★,"""Because my dad promised me."""
169,★★★★★,i dont even know what to say except christopher nolan i love you please stop making me cry
170,★★★★★,someone punch me in the face
171,★★★★★,y'all wanna know what dreams are made of? cooper and murph meeting when they have the same age
172,★★★★★,"I will save my full thoughts on ""Interstellar"" for a upcoming spoiler review upon further reviewings. However, I can clearly state with confidence that ""Interstellar"" is one of the most mindblowing films I ever had at the cinemas. It is emotionally charged, visually impeccable, thought-provoking, and flawlessly acted. I have minor gripes with it, but what movie is ever fully perfect? From my personal standpoint, ""Interstellar"" is a extraordinary experience."
173,★★★★★,this was made...like...this was an idea in someones head and he just went out and did that...and it changed my life forever...cinema
174,★★★★★,"Also this made me bawl my eyes out, holy shit."
175,★★★★,"While I always admired Nolan as a filmmaker, I was never moved by his work. This Sci-Fi Epic that's ultimately (and thankfully for me) more about the unbreakable bond between a father and his daughter than about accurate space time travel finally did that, as Nolan chooses unapologetically and for the first time in his career to focus on emotion rather than logic, making this film a truly memorable one that doesn't feel like a cold documentary as I initially and wrongfully thought it would be."
176,★★★★★,"name a better duo than chris nolan and hans zimmer, i dARE you"
177,★★★★★,the only genre I care about is space redheads saving the world with heart & hope
178,★★★★★,sorry crisis nolan but having a white man be the villain and a women save the world is the most obvious plot development ever
179,★★★★★,"Director Christopher Nolan's masterful sci-fi drama is a feast for the eyes and ears with a (inter)stellar cast -Matthew McConaughey, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain...a wonderful blockbuster with heart and brains."
180,★★,"Hey, nice bolt cutters. Quick question for you: want to pilot a spaceship? Follow-up question: would Tuesday work?"
181,★★★★½,I think he did a fine job this time. Nolan did make an emotional contact finally.
182,★★★★★,4 years and what feels like several thousand re-watches later and it still manages to blow my mind.
183,★★★★,full review on Monday morning (11 AM EST) on Little White Lies.
184,★★★★★,"montage and crosscutting like a motherfucker. Still an absolute powerhouse, I hope that I can one day write something substantial about this one."
185,★★★★★,I can respect that there are people who really dislike Nolan films. But if you don't at least like this film... fuck you
186,★★★★½,"I could be very long-winded and wax poetic about how much I love this movie, but all I want to say is Nolan clearly wanted Michael Caine to look like Ridley Scott for some reason and I think more people should be talking about it."
187,★★★★★,I would literally have sex with this movie
188,★★★★★,"(Ik i'm late like 4 years but still wanna write a long review about this, doing it later)"
189,★★★★★,"The more time has gone by, the more I've realized how deeply Interstellar has stuck with me. Simply one of the most ambitious, beautiful, exhilarating movies of this century."
190,★★★★½,Interstellar is brilliant and I loved every beautiful second of it.
191,★★★★★,the way i will never ever go to space because of this film <3
192,★★★★★,"Overall, Interstellar is a must see. Some truly breathtaking moments and it includes a stellar cast....yeah that was a bad joke. Cheerio!"
193,★★★★★,"""don't let me leave Murph """
194,★★★★½,so humble for the actors to go to literal space and age over a hundred years old just to shoot this movie <3
195,★★★★★,watching this for the second time clears so much confusion up and makes it such an amazing movie i just fell in love
196,★★★★½,me: i would fucking die for you
197,★★★★½,cant believe matt damon was just playing himself (an asshole) in this film
198,★★★★★,...
199,★★★★½,Great on a second viewing in the little dollar theatre I live close too. Interstellar is probably flawed if examined throughly. I don't care. This movie just sucks me into a different world every time I watch it. It's almost like comfort food. It shows me the world is so much bigger than just me and my problems. It's spectacular. The pure sepctical is just awe inspired. It's facinating and it never died down my interest in its story. And I already knew what happened next. Just wonderful.
200,★★★★½,"While there is the occasional flaw, it's so easy for me to overlook due to the overwhelming feelings throughout and Nolan's signature high paced intensity. Zimmer soundtrack perfect (I think I say that every time for him though) and truly breathtaking at times."
201,★★★★★,oh what i would give to go on a date with TARS
202,★★★★,Nice to see Cristopher Nolan has graduated from fear of killing his wife to fear of abandoning his children
203,★★★★★,". This is one of the film's best enjoyed when you sit back and admire its beauty, achievements, and dauntless endeavors."
204,★★★★,trigger warning: an affleck brother
205,★★★★★,"Upping this up to five, why not. As spectacular as Tenet is hilarious. I miss being thrilled by Jessica Chastain."
206,★★★★★,Nolan is (sometimes) a genius.
207,★★★★½,Favorite Soundtracks/Scores List
208,★½,Matthew McConaughey flew with Barney Stinson for SNASA (Secret NASA)
209,★★★★,"I can see why this is one of his most divisive films, but I'm definitely in the crowd that appreciates it for what it is. One of the most ambitious space movies since Kubrick's 2001."
210,★★★★★,This was such an emotional roller Christopher Nolan you whore i love you
211,★★★★★,fuck u matt damon
212,★★★★★,honestly i don't think i have breathed properly since seeing this in theatres 4 years ago i love space so fucking much
213,★★★★½,"Whenever Michael Caine talked all I could see was Secret Agent McMissel. I know people say everyone has sins their past self did that they regret, but I never knew what they meant until I heard the familiar voice of that Volvo P1800."
214,★★★★★,christopher nolan is actually so sexy with his gigantic galaxy brain
215,★★★★½,well that gave me a good cry
216,★★★★½,"Hands down the most beautiful 4K UHD Blu-ray I've seen. I watched the water planet sequence many, many times."
217,★★★★★,"Me: Yeah, Bitch! Hans Zimmer!"
218,★★★★½,my mum learned how to play the interstellar theme on the piano. she didn't know the movie behind the music so we watched it lol
219,★★★★★,society if fathers kept their promises
220,★★★★,"Me not liking the movie at all with the first half, but by the end really really liking it, is what I call character development!"
221,★★★★,"and at its heart is humanity and love. Its visuals, stunning photography, and crescendoing score aid a script that is not without its faults, but the earnestness of Nolan's overall vision pulls it through."
222,★★★★,"So, interstellar. It's probably unlike anything you've seen in terms of ambition. It probably shouldn't work. But, it does. It's something remarkable to behold and if you can see it on film stock you should. I can't tell ya much about plot other than it works in the long run though it can be confusing at times. And good lamb it hit all the emotions. I'm not ready to be a father after watching that. Or maybe I am. I don't know. Let me know whatcha think after."
223,★★★,Never watching this again for real this time
224,★★★★★,Keep it up Christopher Nolan.
225,★★,"Quite possibly Nolan's worst effort to date. An expository load of drivel that has the gumption to continually assault its audience with unnecessary information. If you don't get sick of characters explaining things that make no sense, you'll be bored senseless by the emotionally manipulative score and the ineptitude of the storytelling. ""Disastrous"" doesn't even begin to highlight the movie's lack of restraint."
226,★★★½,"I mean, it's good, but it's not Tenet-good."
227,★★★★★,This is so precisely and desperately what I wanted the marriage of Kubrick and Spielberg to feel like
228,★★★★★,"also i had no idea matt damon was in this , why is he a constant jump scare"
229,★★★★★,"words cannot describe how much i love this movie, the score, everything about it."
230,★★★★½,a different experience for sure.
231,★★★★★,that line where matthew mcconaughey says parents are just here to be memories for their children.... yea
232,★★★★★,we gotta stop sending matt damon into space
233,★★★★★,2014 Films Ranked
234,★★★★,Alright Alright Alright
235,★★★★★,Hans Zimmer's score is the greatest thing my ears have ever heard. I don't have much else to say except that I now realize this is a perfect film.
236,★★★★★,Christopher Nolan somehow made 2 masterpieces
237,★★★★,"Love is quantifiable, whaddya know."
238,½,ive never seen this movie but made out with one of the actors in it
239,★★★★★,"the movie returned to my local theaters and of course i had to go and cry for two hours long,, damn you christopher nolan"
240,★★★★½,me: LOVE! IS! THE! ONE! THING! WE! ARE! CAPABLE! OF! PERCEIVING! THAT! TRANSCENDS! DIMENSIONS! OF! TIME! AND! SPACE!!!!!!
241,★★★★★,"p.s. After 30 years, people will adore this movie. Students will see this movie in school or online class."
242,★★★★½,back in 2014 none of us knew the reason Cooper was crying was that his son Timothee Chalamet grew up to be Casey Affleck
243,★★★★★,matt damon you dumb bitch
244,★★★★★,WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN MOTHERFUCKERS
245,★★,Can I please have those three hours back now?
246,★★★★★,"I feel like this is Nolan's most ambitious,accomplished and complex movie to date. Dealing with the theory of relativity,wormholes,time and space continuum and event horizons. Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain were the stand outs among the cast,which had a lot more cameos than I was aware of. Can't forget Hans Zimmer's amazing score and Hoyt Van Hoytema's incredible cinematography."
247,Added by,Full review here.
248,★★½,.
249,★★½,Disappointing review on its way...
250,★★★★★,"first of all, i'm sorry for only watching this now. second of all, WHAT THE FUCK!"
251,★★★★★,also matt damon belongs in space
252,★★★★½,Nothing is more satisfying than seeing scenes that seemed completely insignificant being threaded (masterfully) into the larger narrative. I literally rewatched this two days in a row to experience it again. I love Nolan.
253,★★★★★,God I hate myself for not being into movies back in 2014 and therefore probably watching horrible bosses 2 in the cinema instead of this masterpiece
254,★★★★★,What happens when scientists bump up against things that defy easy characterization and analysis? Things like love? Humanity and the work that we do that we hand from one generation to the next in the hopes that we might survive and maybe even prosper. What it means to be human.
255,★★★★★,ok so i watched this again just for that Movie Facts tweet about the 1.25 second ticks that happen on miller's planet representing a day on earth passing by and boy that was scary!
256,★★★★★,"We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us."
257,★★,"The problem with this picture is when Americans think about they're apocalyptic future it's never believable. The power of any sci-fi picture is that at some point you believe, even if it's just for a moment, there is no point in Interstellar that this happens. This movie is just another family first, christian morality played out on a green screen. If it wasn't for the intoxicants and the special effects I would have walked out! Nolan has lost what little he ever had."
258,★★★★★,"Y, joder, a veces el granjero salva a la humanidad."
259,★★★★½,"Shut the fuck up , please shut the fuck up"
260,★★½,5/10
261,★★★★½,"As expansive as it is intimate, Interstellar is an immersive, stirring, soulful, thematically ambitious odyssey with great performances, an impeccable production value and numerous sequences that have refused to leave my thoughts since first viewing."
262,★★★★★,"shattered. that was far, far better than i expected. best sci-fi film i've seen since 2001: a space odyssey, hands down."
263,★½,"Will elaborate on later, but this is an incredibly stupid movie that thinks it's far smarter than is."
264,★★★★½,"One second watch, I have grown a much bigger appreciation for this film. While I still feel the film gets too heavy handed with the themes and ideas, this is a visual splendor filled with a fascinating journey. The characters are very compelling and the emotion is through the roof. This is a film I would not be surprised if I enjoy it more upon another rewatch. It is a film I highly recommend."
265,★★★★★,Watching this to pretend I don't have an exam tomorrow that I'm not prepared for. Didn't realise how much I loved it until now - it's going on the Favourites list!

272,★★★★★,JES(U)S CHASTAIN; SAVIOUR OF THE WORLD
273,★★★★★,is it wrong that i still consider this vastly underrated? whenever people talk about it there is always some form of complaint for the love-solves-everything part and no one seems to appreciate how actually GOOD it is

287,★★★★★,Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.
288,★★★★★,best movie of all time period
289,★★★★½,Interesting to see Timothee Chalamet turn in Casey Affleck. Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway killed it with their roles and loved the robots in the film.

I am so glad I finally watched this because it is spectacular and I am in love with everything about it. It was so captivating and beautiful to watch."
298,★★★★★,Science is so fucking sexy.
299,★★★★★,Perfection!
300,★★★★½,"was all about is what makes the movie. Just go see it. Even if you don't love it as much as I do, I can guarantee you'll find it incredibly interesting. Because it is."
301,★★★★½,"Yes, it's repetitive and sentimental. Yes, I don't care. It's also ambitious, bold and thrilling."
302,★★★★★,This happened to my buddy Cooper.
303,★★★★★,"Atemberaubend. Von Anfang bis Ende, Atemberaubend."
304,★★★★★,currently shaking my ass to s.t.a.y by hans zimmer
305,★★★★★,And who said Christopher Nolan was an emotionless director? This movie is nolans most emotional movie. The movie is also full of amazing special effects probably some of the best I seen in any movie and I think that matthew mcconaughey give an amazing preformance possibly his best ever. I am also just in love with the world which Nolan built in this movie.
306,★★★★½,"Mi sa che lo staff del cinema ha preso troppo sul serio il film... in sala si gelava, boh forse mi volevano ibernare e sono il prescelto per salvare il mondo. Probabile."
307,★★★★★,There is a moment
308,★★★★★,fuck i dont know why but i cant stop crying
309,★★½,"Clunky as all hell, but it sure does have a whole bunch of space, space ships, space suits, and robots. Its ambition and scope is also felt, perhaps even so effectively as to be largely numbing, though it did manage to get me in the gut with its unrelenting and utterly cosmic sentimentality once or twice. Saw it on 35mm at the Hollywood Theatre in Portland."
310,½,Whereby famed astrophysicist Christopher Nolan asserts Leonard Susskind is wrong about everything. Worst movie I've seen this year.
311,★★★★★,Space is truly horrifying
312,★★★½,reelrundown.com/movies/Ranking-Christopher-Nolans-Film-1-10
313,★★★★,I'm definitely scare of that water planet. I can't swim.
314,★★★★½,God how do you even quantify this film?
315,★★★★½,"Christopher Nolan's finest film I think, tied with The Dark Knight."
316,★★★★½,however it's been 2 days and i still haven't decided on a rating. i wanna just give it 5 stars but i gotta admit the part near the ending got quite abstract and confusing to me which made me connect with it a little bit less
317,★★★★½,"shit my pants, then went back in time using gravity to shit my pants again"
318,★★★★★,"You ever just, binge a directors work just because a trailer came out? Of course!"
319,★★★★★,"is now one of my favorite movies and that's what i hoped to get from Mr. Nolan. The direction, the script, the cinematography, the performances, everything is totally flawless and left me speechless."
320,★★★★★,that shit is breathtaking bro
321,★★★★½,jessica chastain really is out there saving the world
322,★★★★★,this happens when an ambitious project is executed in perfection and awe. holy mother of christ.
323,★★★★½,"If you don't care about that part of it, you won't like it, no matter how much cool shit you see."
324,★★★★★,"I think what's being lost in all the discussion of the science, narrative and sheer spectacle of this film is the downright fantastic performance from Matthew McConaughey. I feel like he's every bit as good here as in Dallas Buyers Club."
325,★★★★★,"Straight to my number one film of this amazing, brilliant year."
326,★★★★½,'s greatest films in terms of abstract concepts of space and time. What is even more impressive is that many of the concepts used by Nolan are deemed possible by science and research. A great plot full of twists and a must watch!
327,★★★★½,"One of my top five favorite iMax experiences. Simply stunning. Also, a lot of overly self-serious film critics hated it and that really butters my beans."
328,★★★★★,matt damon more like matt demon
329,★★★★★,Shout-out young Timothee.
330,★★★★★,"Mr Nolan your a fucking genius, who has reinvented every genre you've ever put your hand too...And that's all I have to say about that."
331,★★★★★,Still absolutely phenomenal.
332,★★★★½,what a downgrade
333,★★★★★,Nolan Ranked
334,★★★★½,how dare this movie make me cry about matthew mcconaughey
335,★★★★★,5/5 3rd viewing
