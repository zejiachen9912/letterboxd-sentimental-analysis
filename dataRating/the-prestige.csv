1,★★★★,when the prank war just goes too damn far :(
2,★★★★½,"Second unexpected Radiohead in the credits moment THIS WEEK, i need a break"
3,★★★★★,"Forget ""The Dark Knight"". Forget ""The Dark Knight Rises"". Forget even ""Inception"". This film matches the levels of greatness that ""Memento"", my favorite Nolan film, manages to reach, and it does it without telling the story backwards. This is dark, mysterious, captivating, intelligent, and is easily one of Nolan's most under rated films so far."
4,★★★★,nolan: *dj khaled voice* ANOTHER ONE!!!!

6,★½,white male gets tricked into thinking

19,Watched by,due to the glass house I live in.
20,★★★½,it's gay as fuck to be rivals... why are you so obsessed with another man?
21,★★★★½,ABRACADABRA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I JUST!!!! NOLAN YOU GENIUS!!!!!!!
22,★★★★★,One of the greatest films I've ever seen. Period. It's Nolan's best by far. I'm so in shock by how exhilarating and delightful it was that I can't even organize my thoughts.
23,★★★★½,hugh: FUCK!!!!
24,★★★★,i was watching closely and here's what i saw - angier and borden were most definitely gay and were most definitely almost always making out before they became enemies and had to repress their secret gay feelings for each other
25,★★★★½,and see how far that takes him in his career
26,★★★★½,I miss when you could understand what the characters in a Christopher Nolan film are saying
27,★★★★,"when it comes to magic, that Hugh Jackman sure can put on a huge act, man"
28,★★★★★,"is the biggest magic trick ever performed, and Christopher Nolan is the most brilliant magician the world has ever seen."
29,★★★★½,Blink and you miss a detail.
30,★★★★,Directors love magic tricks. Me too.
31,★★★★,the prestige 2006: *loud coughing*
32,★★★★½,"I swear, this film somehow keeps getting better and better every time I watch it!"
33,★★★★½,"oh, so that's what happened to prankvsprank"
34,★★★★★,"My favorite Nolan film to date and that's a hard thing to say when he has titans like Interstellar, Inception, Memento and The Dark Knight under his belt."
35,★★★★★,Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both amazing in their roles. Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansson are also great in their supporting roles. Even David Bowie is great as Tesla.
36,★★★★,Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale get into an extreme dick-measuring contest to find out who's the better magician!
37,★★★,Pacific Design Center
38,★★★★★,"Twists made right, so many clues. Nolan's best movie so far."
39,★★★★★,Undeniably the best Nolan film.
40,★★★★★,ngl to you all i am very drunk but this is the greatest film of all time don't even try and deny it ffs... i love hugh jackman with all my heart... what a pure soul...
41,★★★★★,"This is one of that rare movies that just improves each time you see it. Even when all the secrets are known, there is still immense pleasure in watching everything play out. Are you watching closely?"
42,★★★★,the superior movie in which hugh jackman's character is frequently referred to as a showman
43,★★★★,"A little overlong but also extremely satisfying once it gets to it - truly the first instance of Jackman being recognised as the one greatest showman, and some properly ballsy stuff on ***toxic masculinity***, narcissism, jealousy, sacrifice, power. Good!"
44,★★★½,"scarjo's english accent sounds like she learned it from those teens on tiktok who make ""it's chewsday innit"" videos"
45,★★★★★,"''Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it, because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled.''"

51,★★★★,DID THIS PRANK WAR GO TOO FAR??!! *SHOCKING*
52,★★★★★,THIS is Nolan's best movie.
53,★★★★½,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawaawaq
54,★★★★½,.
55,★★★★★,honestly i'm pretty sure every christopher nolan movie i've seen has left me with my jaw on the flaw and going 'OH MY GOD' even on rewatches
56,★★★★½,life is very unpredictable i could never guess that yesterday was my last day hating magicians
57,★★★★★,Why didn't I watch this 6 years ago?
58,★★★★★,"Unlike a lot of the other films he's made this one actually got better this time around. So engaging, so duplicitous, genuinely such a masterful piece of work."
59,★★★★,www.larsenonfilm.com/prestige-the
60,★★★★★,I recommend watching it multiple times.
61,★★★★★,is a viscerally engaging piece of work that never stops challenging the audience. Truly an incredible masterpiece.
62,★★★★★,A
63,★★★★★,edison & tesla are JUST LIKE angier & bordern woah
64,★★★★,", that's for sure. Gullible and naive me saw absolutely nothing coming. And now that I think about it, I should have seen it coming."
65,★★★½,this is like cady vs regina george but magician edition
66,★★★★★,this was a total headfuck of a film. so many well executed twists and turns throughout it. criminally underrated compared to his other films and was brilliantly done.
67,★★★★,revenge is a dish best served convoluted.
68,★★★★½,"Dark, gripping, cleverly crafted, and delivering hard on twists and turns, The Prestige is one of the more underrated and overlooked efforts from acclaimed filmmaker Christopher Nolan, with great performances, a smart script, engrossing visuals, and a brooding, mystical atmosphere."
69,★★★★½,Vote if you can
70,★★★★★,Also i NEED to see dunkirk at some point it's getting ridiculous
71,★★★★★,"The more I watch this movie, the more I increasingly love, appreciate and continue to be amazed by the amazing talents of Christopher Nolan."
72,★★★★★,"BRAVO! This film is so great, complex and mind blowing. Not only is it entertaining, but I remember being so intrigued & blown away by the ever ending twists and turns this film took when saw this movie for the first time. Such a smart script."
73,Watched by,was skeptical but it delivered and left me craving answers. nice metaphor Chris... I tip my olde thyme top hat to ye
74,★★★★★,Nolan: TWO Christian Bales!
75,★★★★½,the REAL greatest showman
76,★★★★½,rlly beginning to think that christopher nolan is becoming one of my favorite directors
77,★★★★★,"This is Nolan's world, and we are just not marrying in it."
78,★★★★½,Wow. I'd like to issue a formal apology to myself for not watching this film sooner. Amazing!
79,★★★★★,"An absolutely tight, enthralling story that remains a secret masterpiece of the 2000s. Bale and Jackman deliver some of the best performances in their entire repertoires, while the tale is absolutely fascinating, with the rival magicians both being sympathetic at points and reprehensible at others. Pfister's cinematography is gorgeous and Smith's editing allows the endeavor to have the punch it needs. The Prestige is Nolan's best film, using his trademark style to prove that the magic trick is worth nothing without conviction behind it. Still absolutely mesmerizing."
80,★★★★½,films like this constantly remind me why i love cinema this much
81,Watched by,hugh and christian own the stage (pardon the pun) this was truly a roller-coaster and I'm struggling to look for a reason to not give it 5 stars because 5 is real commitment but it was really fuckin good it's been a while since I've leaned forward on my sofa like that in anticipation
82,★★★★,I WAS NOT WATCHING CLOSE ENOUGH
83,★★★★★,There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said a million times tbh this film will always leave me speechless. Bale and Jackman were at the top of their game and the plot twist is undoubtedly one of the best ever man what a picture.
84,★★★½,71/100
85,★★★★½,-Abracadabra nolan is genius haha
86,★★★★,"At the end of the movie, I did not know what to believe anymore. What is real and what is not. Nolan is great. He reached his goal."
87,★★★★,Findley's smarter than me so she figured it out early
88,★★★★½,P.S.: Third time is the charm.
89,★★★★★,the greatest magic trick is this movie making my hair disappear that fast
90,★★★★½,i like your funny words magic man
91,★★★★★,"Oh what's this? Another masterpiece from Nolan? Not a surprise, to be honest."
92,★★★★★,Easily one of my favorites of the 21st century.
93,★★★★½,"The lesson here is to never watch any movies with my brother ever again he asks TOO MANY QUESTIONS like ""how did he do that?"" ""why did he do that?"" ""who's this?"" oh my god shut up you're not supposed to know yet stupid, eat some chips and relax damn"
94,★★★★★,A masterpiece from start to finish. One of Nolan's most underated but powerful films of all time. This is one of the most rewatchable films ever!
95,★★★★★,Holy shit this movie gave me chills. I wish I could watch this for the first time again.
96,★★★★★,PLOT TWIST OF THE CENTURY
97,★★★★★,"The Prestige is a terrific film like a magic trick, you can't reveal how it's done. All the components of the film are well done. There is great tension between the two leading men: Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), which is vital because it's essentially a revenge archetype narrative. There are some fun elements such as bringing in Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) and showers of discharging electricity. Photography is lovely, the color tones throughout are consistent and evocative of the period. Overall, it's an amazing film."
98,★★★★,Bros before hoes.
99,★★★★,my review of this movie is that it whips ass
100,★★★★½,oh my god... g e n i u s
101,★★★★★,holy shit!!!! literally sat there with my mouth wide open during the last act WHEW christopher nolan you genius.. i need to watch this again to fully grasp everything. 2 hour whiplash and i love it
102,★★★★★,"Magic as a metaphor for Filmmaking in the spoiler-centric modern era. Cinema is based on artful deception and illusion. But what if we all know the illusion is a fraud? The sequential nature of cinema forces audiences to read information along with the onscreen characters (The Prestige tells a story about liars should also lie to the audience. Is a magic trick itself). The real paradox (paradox of magic) is that much as the audience wants to know the secret, the secret ultimately will be disappointing."
103,★★★★★,"I think he would make a really good horror film. Would love to see it. If not that, perhaps a film on Tesla and Edison's rivalry from the science guy would be just as good, if not better than The Prestige."
104,★★★★½,"Side note: I rented this movie and later, to my surprise, I searched it on YouTube and it was free right there. I felt like a real dummy guys ngl."
105,★★★★,oh good lord I completely forgot about alcoholic overbite Hugh Jackman...
106,★★★★★,Abracadabra indeed ...
107,★★★★★,How do you take something inherently magical and make magic out of it? Be a genius named Christopher Nolan.
108,★★★★,THAT ENDING.
109,★★★★½,It's a kind of magic
110,★★★★★,that's kinda gay lol
111,★★★★★,Twinsies!
112,★★★★★,"This movie is somehow simultaneously an intricate Swiss watch and the Nolan movie most concerned with human emotions, which is impressive."
113,★★★★,"Has a slow start, but it definitely picks up."
114,★★★★★,"during a scene or two which made me a bit confused sometimes, and Christian Bale's accent felt a bit off during the beginning, but I got used to it after a while. But yeah, otherwise, no flaws whatsoever, don't have much to say, just watch it."
115,★★★★½,the two things I remember most about seeing this film in the theater are the sound of hugh jackman's leg breaking and having my father lean over to me and in no kind of whisper say WHAT JUST HAPPENED about 43 times.
116,★★★★,"After I watched this I had a dream about it, does anyone know where that falls on the 70mm / IMAX / small screen debate? Wouldnt want to upset Christopher"
117,★★★★★,I'm watching the film closely enough to notice that an obsession is a young man's game.
118,★★★,nolan still can't write women huh
119,Watched by,how bloody brilliant
120,★★★★½,Abracadabra
121,★★★,christopher nolan vs using the same actors in every movie he makes
122,★★★★½,prime video watchlist
123,★★★★½,"also if anyone wants to know how bad i am at recognising actors, i spent the first thirty minutes of this thinking that christian bale was tom cruise :)"
124,★★★★★,Still a total mindfuck.
125,★★★★★,This is probably my favourite David Bowie movie next to Labyrinth.he is great as Tulsa.
126,★★★★,"last film of the decade! still have an hour and a half left till 2020 here but happy new year everyone, i hope this new decade brings you all joy and happiness <333"
127,Watched by,christian bale be like: SMACK CAM!!! @ hugh jackman
128,★★★★½,I'm without speech.... Magnificent film.
129,★★★★★,Are you watching closely?
130,★★★★★,"""I lied. He said it was agony."""
131,★★★½,"obsession.Nolan decorates the film with great sets with attention to utmost detail whilst both the leads deliver superb performances nicely playing of each other.The final twist is polarizing to be honest,nonetheless a great experience;just below the Illusionist for me!"
132,★★★★★,"""Inception"" ist wahrscheinlich der beste Nolan Film, aber ""The Prestige"" ist Nolans bester Film."
133,★★½,thank you for watching
134,★★★★★,A true masterpiece on every level.
135,★★★,fellas is it gay to [whatever the fuck just happened]?
136,★★★★★,That ending is breathtakingly sensational. It seems like every film I have seen by Nolan so far is extremely good (Minus Tenet) and this is the next one that can be added to the extremely good list. Christian Bale is also my favourite actor at the moment!
137,★★★★★,"Dare I say masterpiece??? Everything works so well in The Prestige, there isn't a single plot hole, Nolan gives the hint throughout the whole movie but we weren't watching closely the first time! The cast is absolutely incredible, Bowie is a perfectly casted for the role of Tesla. Underrated and better than Inception!"
138,★★★★★,"I love rewatching this and getting better at spotting who is who (if you know, you know). This film exemplifies toxic masculinity and the pointlessness of ""winning"" as revenge. Moreover, these prideful men guaranteed the innate suffering of all the supporting characters who cross their paths, from lovers to coworkers, all loyal constituents thrown under the bus (or carriage?) for a useless vendetta."
139,★★★★,i.imgur.com/9ndFitE.gif
140,★★★★★,this movie is the best movie to ever exist no other movie compares
141,★★★★★,thinking about the annotated spider diagram with pictures I had to draw on my iPad for my classmates who were too intellectually challenged to understand this film when we had to write an essay on it in english class
142,★★★★,christian bale & hugh jackman's characters really hated each other - they're the type to send petty subtweets and give 1 star reviews on trip advisor for each other's performances
143,★★★,in funny moustaches quota.
144,★★★★★,there are so many plot twists in this movie that every viewing you watch of it after the first just gets better and better bc you get to watch it all unfold so perfectly in front of you.
145,★★★★½,if he's a magician in this film.
146,★★★★★,"This movie still blows me away. It's so well crafted, and the ending still hits hard."
147,★★★★,heehee ! naolen made a good movie !!
148,★★★★★,This is the only good steampunk movie.
149,★★★★★,Are you watching closely
150,★★★★½,banget bagus banget memang sempat membingungkan tapi saat perjalanan menjadi menarik mengikutu perjalanan dua pesulap yg terobsesi satu sama lain sehingga merugikan orang lain dan diri mereka sendiri dan film ini membuktikan bahwa Nolan emang salah satu favoritku
151,★★★★½,How much longer are we gonna let Nolan get away with killing love interests for character development? I feel like we need to set some limits.
152,★★★★½,9/10
153,★★★★½,These nerds love magic so much
154,★★★★★,The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast.
155,★★★★★,holy fucking shit
156,★★★★★,how is this movie about rival magicians literally one of the most intense things i've ever seen
157,★★★★★,and if u have no clue what im on about and havent seen one of the best snl skits then u might as well erase all memory of me from ur life because we wont get along
158,★★★★★,.
159,★★★★½,"You really need to be watching closely to uncover every of this movies' secrets. Otherwise, you would have to watch this a second time, which is not a bad thing at all."
160,★★★★½,"Batman vs wolverine. Two magicians try to decode each others magic tricks when one of them develops the ultimate trick and the other tries endlessly to discover the secret. This movie has brilliant cast and acting, the writing is clever and the directing is fantastic."
161,★★★,"how am i supposed to take these guys seriously when they're magicians who sound like ""it's chewsday luv, innit?"""
162,★★★★½,"christopher nolan, ur mind it amazes me sometimes"
163,★★★★★,dead wives! The Nolan-est Nolan movie ever!
164,★★★★★,how can i marry this movie? seriously
165,★★★★★,11/10
166,★★★★★,My mind is still melting... What an absolutely magical piece of filmmaking (pun not intended).

169,★★★½,Christopher Nolan Ranked
170,★★★★,"This was the fourth time I saw this genius, genius film. The last 15 minutes might be a little 'too much' for me, but I can understand the need for it. When I saw it for the first time, in a local cinema, and I saw David Bowie walking in (in the film, mind you), I was 'Holy shit that's DAVID BOWIE'. The man was a great supporting actor as far as commercial films go. The lead is for the art-films - that was David Bowie's story: born for the art."
171,★★★,Think this is pretty genius but just wasn't for me.
172,★★★★½,Hands-down the best movie about the magic industry. Don't @ me.
173,★★★★★,me
174,★★★★,why do you as a man feel the need to be intrinsically obsessed with your male rival lol...... so you can do what?? follow him to his death to tell him a greater secret than any you've told your wife??
175,★★★★½,"I love the way Nolan builds his films, so brilliant."
176,★★★★★,A+
177,★★★★★,PRANK WARS GONE WRONG ***not clickbait ***
178,★★★★★,WOW just WOW. hopefully they might make a sequel to the prestige like Nolan is doing with tenet but with different actors and characters. I can't believe David Bowie is in this as well and a very young Scarlett Johansson
179,★★★★★,One of the greatest twist endings I have ever seen.
180,★★★★,so much sexual tension between these magic men
181,Rewatched by,for a very long time.
182,★★★,this is so sad alexa play christian bale getting pegged
183,★★★,saturday night live cast members can do a british accent better than scarjo like wtf was that

188,★★★½,"Prestige worldwide! Things get crazy at the Catalina Wine Mixer when these magicians put on their coats and shows, coats and shows!"
189,★★★★★,What an insane final act. Christopher Nolan really knows how to add that one final piece to complete a film.
190,★★★★½,the best twist of all time! they twisted the twist! and then twisted it again! very twisty! loved the twists!
191,★★★★,you know who said it doctor Manhattan.
192,★★★★½,(For now at least)
193,★★★★★,"Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled."
194,★★★½,I looked away for ten seconds and now there's three Christian Bales and two Hugh Jackmans and a partridge in a pear tree and why the hell do I actually recognize Andy Serkis when I see him. What is going on?
195,★★★★,this had me...como se dice...shook.
196,★★★★,the ending was worth it
197,★★★,.

206,★★★★,"compelling it completely masks the fact that you're watching Batman, Scrooge, Wolverine, Coyote Ugly, Black Widow, Gollum, and Ziggy Stardust interact with one another. Now, that's one hell of a trick."
207,★★★★½,8.6/10
208,★,"I don't know what I'm supposed to be responding to. Everything about how Nolans movies move feels so meticulously sapped of flavor. It's basically as close to absolute zero as cinematic form can get while still maintaining a posture of ""professionalism"" and some Spectre of ""auteurial distinction"". Like, it's maybe not quite as anticinematic as a literal design by committee sort of production, but it's close enough to be downright eerie. At least the actors seem somewhat invested, because the images certainly aren't."
209,★★★★★,"A new favourite of mine. Sensational from Chris Nolan, twist after twist with two incredible characters going head to head. Things you love to see."
210,★★★★★,WHAT THE FUC-DABRA!
211,★★★★★,does anyone have christopher nolan's phone number cus he took my wig and i would like it back now
212,★★★★,best ending of any Nolan movie. underrated as heck. *poof* i'm disappeared binch
213,★★★½,"This movie left me somewhat cold the first time I saw it, but over the years, I've come to appreciate the performances, the typically Nolan-esque puzzlebox structure and, most of all, the brilliant marriage of theme, subject matter and setting. It ends up making some interesting and ingeniously-presented points about film, performance and the impact of scientific progress on our collective imagination."
214,★★★★½,I haven't seen this since 2006 and I'm really glad I rewatched this. Easily one of Nolan's best.
215,★★★★½,Draco Malfoy did it first with the vanishing cabinet just saying
216,★★★★★,HOLY SHIT ??? IM SPEECHLESS
217,★★★★½,"is one of the best of that very particular type of movie. Nolan crafts a wondorous, yet realistic world, and extremely gripping characters, played excellently by the likes of Bale, Jackman, Hall, Cane, etc. The complex plot, and multiple twists, will require repeated viewings, and I definitely haven't got the full extent of it quite yet, so I'm not giving this my highest grade, but it was really damn great. 9/10"
218,★★★★½,Easily one of my favorite Nolan films. Late as hell to the party but kinda loved this one.
219,★★★★½,that twisted ending still bends my mind.
220,★★★★,boy what the hell boy

225,★★★★★,if i could marry a film i would marry this film
226,★★★½,fellas is it gay to ruin your own life whilst trying to ruin the life of your lifelong nemesis
227,★★★★★,"There are parts of this film that reach such masterful levels of cinematic gold that few other films can dream about, let alone come near. Chrissy Nolan is in maximum beast mode here."
228,★★★★★,Edit (15/11/2020): I hate my old reviews so much.
229,★★★★,"The greatest show. For a movie about the artistry of misdirection it's worth noting that this is probably the most straightforward and less visually embellished of all the Nolan projects. It's still masterfully made and the text painting approach to the narrative arcs equating to the steps of a magic trick is really clever, just think the actual prestige part isn't as impressive as the film wanted to be."
230,★★★½,This is like exhausting to watch I feel like I've run 5k
231,★★★★★,100/100
232,★★★★★,"If you were to see a 2nd Nolan film in my Top 100, its this one."
233,★★★★,ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY!!!!?!?!?!?!??!!?!?!

241,★★★★½,i'd recognize christian bale's lips anywhere...
242,★★★★½,will always be my fav nolan film alongside memento
243,★★★★½,i wish christian bale could say abracadabra and magically give me more brain cells and all my hair back after nolan scalped me
244,★★★★½,The whole bird metaphor.. where one had to die to get replaced by a replica. FUCKING GENIUS
245,★★★★½,what the fuck
246,★★½,anyway this was fine but i figured out christian bale's part of the ending before it was revealed so either i've seen too many nolan movies or that makeup was...not good
247,★★★★½,Astonishing brilliance in all areas of filmmaking.
248,★★★★,WOW
249,★★★★★,Another Nolan masterpiece
250,★★,feels wrong to rate a movie that features both ricky jay and david bowie this low but at a certain point midness becomes unforgivable.
251,★★★★★,"Absolutely my favorite Nolan film so far. As confusing as anything in the plot may be, it's just too damn good. The screenplay is masterful, every twist and turn has an impact on the plot, Nolan's direction is spectacular, and the ending is mindblowing. Couldn't have been more satisfied"
252,★★★★★,"After the shitty day I had, needed this film. One of my personal favourites. Never fails to amaze me. Nolan's best."
253,★★★★½,imagine if Prince had played Tesla
254,★★★★★,YEAAA NOLAN FUCKING ROCKKKS OHHH YEAAAAAA OH YEAAA THIS IS SO GOOD

257,★★★★½,9/10
258,★★★★½,I completley forgot how much I love this film. The prestige does everything I love about christopher nolans films as it is very thought provoking and suspensful. I thought that the story about two magicians rivalry and how the are trying to top one another is fantastic
259,★★★★★,HOLY SHIT!
260,★★★★★,hugh jackman really is the greatest showman huh
261,★★★★★,Attack of the Clones
262,★★★★½,this was WILD. i honestly did not see that ending coming
263,★★★★★,"Farewell, Mr. Bowie. Thanks for all the magic."
264,★★★★★,This is my favorite Nolan. :)
265,★★★★★,"This was UNBELIEVABLE. I can't decide between five and four and a half, but I think I'll go with five just because I'm such a nice guy. I might end up changing it though. I absolutely adore Bale and Jackman in this. Can't decide which one is my #MCM. The monologue that the movie ends on is absolutely brilliant too. Who knew such a good film could be made about some goofy ass English magicians."
266,★★★★★,Introduced my kids to this masterpiece today. They loved it. And I liked it better than ever!

277,★★★★★,.
278,★★★★★,Grade: A+
279,★★★★,who told scarlett johansson her british accent was good i just wanna talk
280,★★★★★,Blew my mind! Their intense rivalry leading to that ending was both exhilarating and awesome to watch at the same time!
281,★★★★★,well FUCK my mind is blown
282,★★★★★,"cemented Nolan as an integral director in our society, delivering once again a fantastically written and paced story. Not only that, but his narrative genius and two incredible performances from Bale and Jackman added to the uncanny yet riveting atmosphere created."
283,★★★★★,"Well Done, Christopher Nolan."
284,★★★★,"2nd best film I've ever seen from Christopher Nolan. Great acting, cast, story and plotwist. The man has a lot of talent."

289,★★★★½,A cannot wait to see this again.
290,★★★★★,"Impeccably crafted to the point where it becomes a point of pride in re-watching, admiring, and piecing together the obviousness."
291,★★★★★,men just always have to one up each other
292,★★★★★,Just mindblowing. It's strange watching it the second time round knowing the secrets but it's a completely different but delightful experience. I do wish that I could watch films like these with fresh eyes sometimes though. Nolan's a genius. Simple.
293,★★★★½,Nolan's one truly great film.
294,★★★★,"A brilliantly directed film by Chris Nolan (as usual really). An enthralling tale of deceit, deception and obsession, with a great central performance from Christian Bale and well backed up by the ever present Michael Cain. Only bad points are Scarlett Johansson and Hugh Jackman's accents. P.S - any film with a David Bowie cameo gets a massive thumbs up from me!"
295,★★★★★,to out do the other. this was just a super fun watch and i highly recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it.
296,★★★½,in order of release
297,★★★★★,This film is always damn good. I showed it to my grandpa today and he enjoyed it. I just wanted to see his reaction to the ending. The acting is awesome as it has 3 of my favorite actors and 2 great actresses. Rebecca Hall is so dang underrated. She is Oscar worthy in this film. This movie is so edge of your seat and I love it so much. You have to pay attention to the first shot otherwise you miss details. I get something new every time. It is top 5 Nolan for sure!!!
298,★★★★½,"i would never reveal my true thoughts about this movie, as you so foolishly thought i would. my wit and insight will forever be lost to time."
299,★★★★★,"To me, the greatest filmmaker. My biggest inspiration."

303,★★★★,rebecca hall army rise up!!!
304,★★★★★,WOAHHHH MIND NUMB!!! nolan u are so crazy cool i love u ur crazy wow wowowowowow ur mind is so large give me just a sliver of ur mind just one piece
305,★★★★★,"this is insanely amazing what the fuck, the looks on MY face were hilarious every time the plot progressed"
306,★★★★,Alfred Borden: Abracadabra.
307,★★★★★,Chills. Chills every time
308,★★★½,7/10
309,★★★★,the most confusing thing about this is trying to grasp the fact that hugh jackman is the one doing an accent not christian bale
310,★★★★★,"Fun fact: The editing includes one hundred forty-six time jump cuts, in which the next shot either flashes back or skips ahead to another time period of the storyline, this averages to almost one timeline jump per minute of movie"
311,★★½,"all of this is still quality mainstream - with some amazing images, though take the final construction as you want, a sleight of hand in the worst case, a fall beyond the own cleverness."
312,★★★★,me: :0
313,★★★★½,Best of 2006
314,★★★★★,"My new favorite Nolan film? Yep, my new favorite Nolan film"
315,★★★★,angrier
316,★★★★½,me loading the gun: I SAID WHERE IS IT
317,★★★★½,IN FRONT OF MY SALAD???
318,★★★★★,"Holy shit, that was amazing."
319,★★★½,i aspire to be as petty as hugh jackman and christian bale are in this film
320,★★★★★,"Christopher Nolan while making this movie: ""A real magician creates something new something that people will scratch their heads over!!!"
321,★★★★½,is the greatest show
322,½,"no jokes im seriously convinced this is one of the worst movies ive ever seen, how the FUCK does it have a 4.1"
323,★★★★★,"i can't believe i fucking ADORED this film of logan and bruce wayne deceiving the audience, trying to ruin each other's magic tricks and competing for david bowie's invention"
324,★,please feel free to comment bc i really don't get what the hell is it that impressed everyone so much
325,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan can do no wrong
326,★★★★½,"Amazing and I love this movie so much, but am I the only one wondering why Angier literally chose to keep commiting ritual suicide and then being regenerated each evening instead of just keeping one double like Borden did?"
327,★★★★★,This makes Now You See Me looks like Teletubbies.
328,★★★★★,my brain hurts
329,★★★★½,disappointed it took so long for me to finally watch this
330,★★★★,This movie was just 2 magicians trolling each other for 2 hours. Definitely liked it better than tenet.
331,★★★★½,Kojima moment
332,★★★★★,just two besties obsessed with each other
333,★★★★½,Real magicians punching the air rn...
334,★★★★★,my dad thinks christopher nolan is a psychopath
335,★★★★½,bro....
336,★★★★★,Bumped up to 5 stars!
337,★★★½,Took my a while to get into this one but by the time it ended I was fully on board.
338,★★★,"would have cost much less time and effort to simply kill the other man, dont they have any idea how easy it was to get away with murders back then?"
339,★★★★,shoutout to Rick for reminding me to watch this one lmao S4 EP8
340,★★★★½,abracadabra babey
341,★★★★★,"The Prestige is the exact reason I love Christopher Nolan movies. He invokes my sense of wonder. He does things that no one else is doing, which challenges himself and others. I showed this to the ole bag and she really liked it. She loves a good mystery, a good twist. This delivers the goods, and is primed for a rewatch."
342,★★★★½,also me: WHAT THE FUCK?!
343,★★★★★,WHAT THE FUCK?!?!?!?!!??
344,★★★★½,9.7/10.
345,★★★★,"This time I noticed like no other how often and how early different characters are essentially SHOUTING the twist at each other. People who guessed it in advance just listened better, but it doesn't make the movie ""bad"" -- it actually has characters literally speak to each other about how the world is simple and horrible and twists make things seem possible again for a moment until you ruin it."
346,★★★★★,"films are a 5/5 for me, but this one gets a 6/5."
347,★★★★,This movie stole my wig and all of my top hats
348,★★★★★,ABRACADABRA IM ON THE FLOOR
349,★★★,isn't scarlet just amazing?
350,★★★★½,"Rewatching this movie makes it better than it already was. Compared to other Nolan movies *cough* Inception *cough* you can admire every single twist, turn and detail that leads to the movie's climax."
351,★★★★,"my dad is drafting an angry letter to christopher nolan right now yelling at him for making tesla seem like a ""quack"""
352,★★★★★,hugh jackman can eat me alive. just fucking kill me.
353,★★★★★,Best super hero movie ever.
354,★★★★½,"Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman & Michael Caine gives excellent performances in this awesome Christopher Nolan movie with a surprising twist at the end!"
355,★★★★,"Watching the film this time, it was incredible to see how the pieces fit so well together: the art direction, the cinematography, the acting, the direction, the music, the brilliant non-linear script. The film is amazing on all accounts and that the magic here is essentially a metaphor for film itself makes the payoff even better as the twists are revealed at the end. The film's human themes are strong too, transcending the subject of magic and becoming something ubiquitous and somewhat scary."
356,★★★★½,Watched on Movies Anywhere.
357,★★★★½,Jackman!
358,★★★★★,"I'm genuinely speechless, what a masterpiece. I'm definitely going to be watching more Nolan films."
359,★★★★★,"And that, is the real prestige."
360,★★★★★,"Honestly, the plot has the stomach-churning, the bottom falls out your heart with dread effect of Oldboy"
361,★★★★★,Mind definitely blown. I wanna rewatch right now and pick up on everything I missed.
362,★★★★★,well... fuck
363,★★★★★,"just the fact that someone out there had the thought to make a movie this expertly and near impeccably crafted.. wow, i am at a loss for words. the prestige is the embodiment of genius and masterful film-making. as simple as that."
364,★★★★★,Discussed on Episode 34 of the Feelin' Film Podcast
365,★★★★★,I'm speechless.
366,★★★★★,best movie ever i think
367,★★★★½,Christopher Nolan Ranked
368,★★★★★,"Fellas is it gay to become bitter rivals who constantly one up each other through betrayal, sacrifice and obsession in pursuit of becoming the best magician the world has ever seen???"
369,Watched by,did they explore each other bodies
370,★★★★,BATMAN vs WOLVERINE > BATMAN vs SUPERMAN
371,★★★★,"Perhaps Nolan's most precise and calculated effort. Subsequently, the big reveals grow more unsettling the longer you dwell on them."
372,★★★★½,9/10
373,★★★★★,This is just genius filmmaking. Nolan's best.
374,Rewatched by,this is the only movie ever made where I don't remember anything and also remember everything
375,★★★★½,"Basic premise of the film- two grown men steal each others diaries, get jealous and start a prank war. And man was it entertaining."
376,★★★★,One of the better Nolan films
377,★★★★★,i aint ever seen 2 pretty twins...nvm that dont sound right
378,★★★★★,this movie is truly the most amazing movie i have ever seen and i will never get tired of it. ever. i love it more than i love myself
379,★★★★½,the prestige is to the illusionist what old dogs is to wild hogs
380,★★★★½,"fooled myself by thinking that i was, indeed, watching closely"
381,★★★★½,"An underrated Nolan movie. People mention Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Inception when they talk about their favorite Nolan movie, but they don't often mention The Prestige. The Prestige is actually a competently made movie. The twists are really great and it just so fun to rewatch it because you can see all the twists coming. Jackman and Bale are amazing as two really ambitious magicians."
382,★★★★½,Easily Nolan's best. Full of his most colourful and fully realised characters and truly kaleidoscopic in a way a film about magic should be.
383,★★★★★,"In my case, I was not watching it closely enough hahaha."
384,★★★★,christopher nolan how about you make a movie i can understand for a fucking change?
385,★★★★,Nolan really thought he was slick putting a beard and chubby cheeks on Christian Bale and thinking nobody would notice huh
386,★★★★,"""Abracadabra"""
387,★★★★★,magic is terrifying
388,★★,enough.
389,★★★★,"A great meditation on magic and obsession, even if I've seen it too many times to be shocked anymore. Supremely well done and slightly out of character for Nolan."
390,★★★★,This movie is truly magical. Every re-watch adds more to the story and empowers it.
391,★★★★½,4/5
392,Watched by,"My expectations were high, but damn..."
393,★★★,christopher nolan never fails to make me have literally no idea what's going on in any of his movies
