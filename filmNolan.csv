3166,insomnia-2002,★★★★½,"Unfairly criticized for simply being a remake in the first place, Nolan makes all the right changes for a mass audience while still making a black and bleak modern noir with one of Pacino's better modern performances.",4.5,0.067,0.856,0.078,0.1027
3167,insomnia-2002,★★★½,"As much as I did like it, the film could have been significantly better.

The incongruent settings contrasting against each were a strong central point for the film, credit to the production designer for that.",3.0,0.049,0.743,0.208,0.8658

3187,insomnia-2002,★★★★½,It's so weird to see Robin Williams as a bad guy. I mean I'm so used to seeing him in stuff like Mrs. Doubtfire and Good Will Hunting. This shows that he is capable of quite a great range. I thought it was super cool how much they drew parallels between characters that were so different at their fundamental levels. I loved the discussion of how corruption is caused one tiny step at a time. And a discussion of whether or not the ends justify the means and whether or not there become a multiplicity of ends from one means. Incredible film.,4.5,0.049,0.752,0.199,0.9517
