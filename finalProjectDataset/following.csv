2,Christopher Nolan Ranked
3,"Short and sweet, twisty little film that shows a lot of that early Nolan love of non-linear. Lot's of ideas here that later become more solidified in Memento, but still holds it's own. Much like ""Pi"" the black and white makes the low budget feel a little more stylish."
4,"what a surprise, a film made by christopher nolan would turn out to be mediocre bullshit"
5,i was not expecting to like this anywhere near as much as i did. nolan really showed what he could do from the start.
6,Low Budget extravaganza.
7,"This Nolan kid has got a lot of potential, I'm curious to see what he'll do next. Maybe he should hit up Hollywood and see if he'll get any luck there."

9,That's saying a lot.

11,", Christopher Nolan embarked on his most ambitious effort yet...making me bored! And he certainly delivered...the man doesn't miss!"
12,6.0 / 10
13,as if i needed more reason to not trust anyone!!!! thanks christopher nolan

15,)
16,A mediocre movie? Directed by Christopher Nolan? No...
17,why is this on criterion lmao
18,90/100
19,"For a low budget indie, Nolan showcases his skills as a director right off the bat. Such an Intriguing movie that should inspire future filmmakers for decades to come"
20,so here we are.
21,"Overall, I very much enjoyed Following with a clever story and excellent performances. Cheerio!"
22,"may not be Christopher Nolan's most refined film, but it's surely one of his most unique."
23,"So cool to see this early Nolan film and realize how much he was able to build on these ideas and narrative style! It's not perfect by any means, but it's exactly what you would expect his first feature (film on just $6000!!) to be like."
24,"Super easy to recommend, especially to Nolan fans who still haven't seen it."
25,Score: 9/10
26,is a great caper stretched a little long despite its short length.
27,"It's exactly what you'd expect from 1) Nolan 2) as a first time director. It definitely works better looking back on his career, after works like Memento and The Prestige which really solidified Nolan in his twisty style so that when watching Following we appreciate it because it's Nolan even if it's not always great."
28,Fantastic Debut from Nolan.
29,Please return to your roots and make a small-scale mystery thriller again!
30,literally every problem in this could have been avoided if they followed the golden rule of never trusting straight men
31,"thank you Nolum, very cool!"
32,"OH, AND ONE MORE THING: you will meet another Family member from the Nolan branch."
33,"A vaguely interesting starter project totally blindsided by amateur writing. I promise this isn't interesting enough for exposition dumps, Chris. It's perhaps most interesting because of how many hats Nolan was wearing for the debut, giving it at least that spark that comes from one person realizing a concept. I'm shocked the average rating is as high as it is, more shocked this dull clunker is somehow in the Criterion Collection? Very strange!"
34,"Walau budgetnya minim, dan sinematografinya menggunakan konsep hitam putih, namun ketika dibuat oleh sutradara sekelas Christopher Nolan, tentunya hasilnya berkelas,dan jauh dari kata murahan."
35,"Nolan's debut is a low budget neo noir with shades of Hitchcock. Some of his best known films have great plot twists,this movie has one which is hard to predict. There is an ambiguity to certain scenes which just makes it quite intriguing. A great start to a wonderful career."
36,remains internally consistent and relies on nothing more than good storytelling to deliver its knockout blow. An engrossing debut.
37,Interesting concept that loses it's steam roughly 10 minutes in and never manages to catch back up again for the rest of the runtime
38,". It's pretty cool to see what Nolan can do with a small budget and such a short runtime. Some of the violent scenes are a bit silly and the acting isn't that good, but it's still a pretty well-written film that definitely wouldn't hurt to check out."
39,worth a watch for film genealogists who like tracing an auteur's obsessions back to their... inception...
40,I love this. such an interesting story and I love how it unravels.
41,Nolan Ranked
42,This was the only Nolan's film that I was missing.
43,Would recommend.
44,"Flawed on a technical level (some editing and choreography issues), and the acting isn't the greatest, but overall a good, promising directorial debut from Christopher Nolan. If this were the first Nolan movie I had watched, I would've been curious to see what he does next."
45,"Technical issues aside (although this is unsurprising given its $6,000 budget), Following is a compelling and extremely well-crafted dramatic neo-noir crime thriller that also serves as a strong directorial debut from writer and director Christopher Nolan."
46,"Definitely a bit slow at points and the restrained budget does hold Nolan back from making something truly special, but this is still a solid debut that is way better than it has any right to be. It has an interesting premise as well as solid performances and solid direction from Nolan. It's nothing substantial but it does show hints of Nolan's greatness that's to come."
47,Queue The Plan by Travis Scott
48,Thank you.
49,nolan never fails to astonish me
50,"But I appreciate the artistry and how well it's made for its budget. It's a film that shows promise but again, the leap between this and Nolan's sophomore effort is HUGE."
51,Had plenty of potential but fell short in some areas.
52,"4. Stalking is bad, kids."
53,This movie is a near masterpiece. I do not understand why it is so lowly rated. Maybe I'm just crazy.
54,completely tolerable proto-Nolan
55,Beer: Brasserie Meteor Wendelinus Belgian Pale Ale - 4/5 (I can drink this all day)
56,Ok this movie is actually underrated. We really get to see how nolan started all of his ideas in his movies and it's interesting to see them in this type of story. I like how it takes the crime genre and flips it on it's head at the end. The cinematography actually is decent as well as the performances yeah sure the violence is laughably bad but this movie is actually good.
57,The Criterion Channel
58,Hmm... this Nolan kid's got potential. I wonder what he'll do next. He should try his luck at Hollywood
59,"And with that, I've now seen every Christopher Nolan movie. I don't know what took me so long to finally watch this, because I've always known about it, but just never found the time to watch it. I have to say this movie is pretty amazing. Sure it's low budget, but it's pretty awesome. The performances are great and the writing in this movie takes it to a different level. The music was awesome too. Didn't sound like anything I had heard before. Everything great about Nolan is in this movie, so he really knew what he wanted even at his first feature."
60,"If Christopher Nolan hadn't become CHRISTOPHER NOLAN, it'd be interesting to see how Following would be remembered. Right now, it's seen as the debut feature from a titan of blockbuster filmmaking, but on its own merits, its a brisk neo-noir that demonstrates the techniques and ideas that Nolan returns to time and again in this filmmaking (there's even a criminal/storyteller hybrid character named Cobb!). No one would says Following is Nolan's best feature, but I'd certainly say it's one of the better feature debuts of the last 50 years."
61,Everyone has a box.
62,anyone who gives this less than four stars... who hurt you?
63,"There isn't anything particularly groundbreaking or amazing about ""Following"", yet that's kind of primarily why it really works. Largely a self-contained, and personal thriller showcasing Nolan's strength in building suspense and storytelling. Certainly at about the bottom of his filmography, working with bigger budgets obviously gives a filmmaker like him a lot more room to work, but nevertheless it's a pretty thoroughly compelling noir."
64,"(25/03/16: just minorly edited this review from last year, which seems to have pushed it back into the activity feed!)"
65,in great quality :)
66,soon.
67,"It's intriguing and well-made, but that's about it. Like aunt theresa's lasagna"
68,"Christopher Nolan's directorial debut. It's short with a runtime of about an 1hr10m, but with a budget of a mere $6,000 it's actually well made and quite interesting."
69,even more as a filmmaker.
70,Based
71,People always say Nolan doesn't have a signature style but arguably the most interesting thing about watching his low budget debut feature in 2020 is seeing how much it already felt like a Christopher Nolan movie. It has all the quirks and tropes you've seen in bigger Nolan movies but now his friends act in it and it's shot in grainy 16mm black and white film. It's not a bad movie at all but I think it's only interesting in retrospect.
72,I think the most interesting aspect of this is seeing the promise of what is to come later in his career.
73,"You Pick, I Watch."
74,"4.25 stars, last of Christopher Nolan's films I had yet to seen. Gosh he's good."
75,Nolan make a bad movie challenge
76,begins...
77,7.4/10 (B).
78,"Also, very solid David Julyan score!"
79,nolan characters named Cobb >>>
80,"Some of you guys out here are extremely critical of this film. Knowing that this is Nolan's first movie out of film school, it is extremely impressive and engaging. You can see Nolan really trying to find his writing style and breaking into these ideas of manipulating time to tell a story. It might not be explosive or enchanting like every single one of his films after this but it was made on a shoestring budget with a limited crew. From my experiences in film school, I would be genuinely shocked if someone could come right out of the gate making something this impressive."
81,"the film does have its flaws, but the story itself, the structure and the cinematography make up for most of the issues (in my opinion)."
82,"Undoubtedly, this movie in one of the highest quality low-budget movies you'll ever see."
83,"An impressive debut for sure, gonna give it a rewatch soon. Really really really really REALLY rough around the edges, like really rough around the edges. But I really liked it."
84,2020 First Watches Ranked
85,"""You take it away... to show them what they had."""
86,just mull over those numbers
87,podcast
88,"Like most Nolan films, my mind is all like ""Whhhaaaa?"" Unsurprisingly his debut is no exception."
89,but packed into 70 minutes of semi vignettes of breaking an entering. I can completely appreciate a streamlined and concise film that stands out as a terrific calling card for a new auteur voice.
90,"With the impending release of the Dark Knight Rises I thought I would revisit Christopher Nolan's back catalog. I had never seen this film before and was very impressed by it. Shot with virtually no budget and at friend/family's locations, the smart script and impressive direction stand out. An ingenious plot with twists and turns showcase what we came to expect from Nolan in the years ahead."
91,"Also, ironically, the name of the thief in this film is COBB, the name of the lead in Inception. Maybe this is a prequel to Inception; Cobb in his pre-dream stealing days?"
92,also notice the batman sticker on his front door...subtle & inconceivable nod to Nolan's future projects hmmmmmm
93,exceptional directorial debut from nolan.
94,.)
95,"Christopher Nolan's first (and worst) theatrical film???? Well, you got start from somewhere."
96,8.4/10
97,"With a production of no more than 50 dollars, Nolan introduces himself as a genius director with a genius movie"
98,"Christopher Nolan's noirish thriller is an uncommonly polished and assured feature debut, highly clever textually and supremely accomplished technically. This ultra low-budget exercise marks the emergence of a significant directorial talent."
99,pretty good for a debut
100,"With Following, Nolan shows the world his brand of neo-noir for the first time, in quite an impressive fashion and gives us a glimpse of what he is capable of."
101,is mind blowing.
102,.
103,My dude really loves him some non-linear storytelling.
104,"-like score). Solid debut, all in all."
105,"Wow, what a debut from Nolan. He defined his style right from the start. I love his non-linear movies (literally every single one) and Memento is a great follow up to this movie. It is cool that one door had Batman sign on like Nolan knew he will do Batman films."
106,I really enjoyed the opening fifteen minutes or so and then I gradually stopped FOLLOWING what was going on. Thank god Nolan learnt how to do non linearity properly
107,An interesting debut by Nolan and a great little case of neonoir. Glad that he never gave up messing with timelines.
108,this was so cool and the ending twist was so good!!! nolan is such an intelligent filmmaker
109,"well, christopher nolan sure has improved over the past 19 years...not that this was bad, but i didn't love it like i love nolan's other movies. this still had me shook though"
110,fatpie42.livejournal.com/266588.html
111,"Nolan is as far up his own ass in this as he is in Tenet, but at least characters swear profusely. The script thinks it's way cleverer than it really is, and the filmmaking is extremely inelegant (also like Tenet), but at least Following has the excuse of being a debut. Rough stuff and highly annoying, I'd take Memento over this any day of the week, as I'm sure most people would. Not awful, not good at all, I'm totally indifferent towards this."
112,A much more skewed following-to-burglary ratio than I expected
113,Still better then Tenet
114,Probably the single best panty fetish movie ever made - 7/10.
115,oh my god pack it up nolan
116,"Nolan is an amazing director, and I get why a lot of people don't like his movies, but I personally love them and I'm so excited to see what he does now after Tenet"
117,3/5
118,Big Hitchcock vibes but it was seriously lacking in sound and score during important scenes.
119,para ser una de Nolan
120,"Christopher Nolan's first movie: an overture, to not only Memento, but to the wickedly brilliant mind of Christopher Nolan."
121,Very boring up until the last 5 minutes. Is that enough to justify watching it? Probably not.
122,"It's a good working film because it's so independent of producers and studio bosses. It's well working because Nolan can do what he want with his low budget. This is the most ambitious Nolan film with the exception of Dunkirk. Many will disagree, but you can feel he has a passion with what he's doing, instead of just directing like the producers want him to. Sure it has it's flaws, but it's a great handwork and just as thought-provoking as Inception, if not more."
123,"Hell yeah, 70 minutes."
124,"The performances are strong and it actually has an interesting plot, save for the middle act which was a huge dip in quality."
125,"An excellent display of the beginning of Christopher Nolan's trademark film style and technical skills, along with the troubled and complex characters that he is known for creating. [B-]"
126,"is an interesting exploration into minimalist noir filmmaking. The cinematography and lighting are exquisite, both giving the film a claustrophobic atmosphere and a grim tone. Nolan shows both his talent and interest in non-linear storytelling, and for the most part it works. The only thing working against this film is its very short runtime, and an abrupt (though excellent) ending."
127,community theater nolan. oddly charming! kind of boring!
128,Erstmal einen Nolan ballern.
129,I really prefer the old copy of Christopher Nolan than the new one
130,"For such a small budget and for the first try in terms of an actual feature it's kinda impressive what this guy achieved with this. Actually This story reminds me of Hitchcock's Rope, in a good way."
131,7/10
132,poster and batman logo :)
133,"Completed Nolan's filmography with his impressive directorial debut. You can already see some of his trademarks coming through. The 'action scenes' were clumsy, but what would you expect with a budget of $6000."
134,Accomplishes a lot with very little.
135,Leave a comment and let me know what you-
136,I'am seriously impressed. Wasn't expecting anything but Nolan really surprised me. Nice debut bruh
137,GOOD
138,And thus began the legendary career of one of the best filmmakers of the 21st Century
139,"this movie cost 6,000$ to make, wow."
140,"Woah. I had low expectations going into this and turns out I'm a silly bitch for being so presumptuous. Despite its low budget, you can still definitely tell it's Nolan at the helm. His signature razor sharp editing and snappy dialogue work so well for this film. I just wish the timeline jumps were a little easier to follow, so that we wouldnt need the cliche exposition dump in the third act. Other than that though, a phenomenal treat to watch!"
141,82%
142,"In which Chris Nolan realizes if you confuse people, they will just say your movie is smart."
143,Marvellous debut of legend nolan
144,"As an aspiring filmmaker, it's so cool to see a film that proves an intriguing story makes a film, not visuals and camera quality. I definitely need to rewatch this."
145,"Sure, I get it's an early work from Nolan. I get it. But, like, the two male protagonists have names and the only woman prominently featured in the film is named The Blonde??? And she's only there as an object of desire?? Yikes! Neo-noir blah blah stylistic choice blah blah wahhhhhhhh boys are dumb and film boys are dumber."
146,"Outstanding work for Christopher Nolan's first feature film. Made on a budget of $6000 and filmed on weekends, this shows the beginning of a very talented and confident filmmaker. Following plants the seeds for Nolan's trademark non-linear storytelling."
147,Looks like a student film yet is still better than 75% of the stuff that comes out today. Nolan truly is a God.
148,Feels like someone trying to do Hitchcock on their first at bat.
149,"Another Christopher Nolan movie that demands a rewatch- and I'm grateful for that. Not because it was confusing, but because when the end came around he called back details or moments from before that I recalled and I know there were more that I missed. The interesting story unfolds as the main character unfolds it themself. This is wholly an original and unique piece of work done by Nolan that nobody can ever re-create. And I totally see the noir effects he reuses in most of his later films."
150,"Following is a minute long. Blink, and you'll miss it."
151,"The film noir feeling really get's me in this one, and the story is really interesting. As for the budget it is interesting to look through the movie and see how they have tried to do every single thing so it would be cheaper. But this is a good example that with a great team and an idea and talent you can really make something special without that much money in your pocket."
152,"Also, 360 films this year WHOOOOOO 6 more to go"
153,"Christopher Nolan is one of my favorite movie directors. His debut movie, ""The Following"" is a really interesting small budget mystery thriller. The twists were really good, the acting was good, and the story was really captivating. I realize it was shot in black-and-white because of budget limitations, but it made the main two characters look very similar, which paid off in the end."
154,"A wonderful piece of neo-noir. Nolan shows some skill in his debut. The story is simple: random happenstance that causes the main character's life to spiral out of control. The fractured screenplay that he used so brilliantly in Memento was put to good use here and probably served as a playing ground for that film; works quite brilliantly with the climax. The acting is adequate and plays into the feel of the film well. The music accentuates the film; quite subtle, but the main theme adds some nice intensity. Nolan shows attention to detail with his photography."
155,6/10 meh
156,imagine if nolan had directed fight club instead of fincher and also if he had written the screenplay UGH im shaking literally tyler and the narrator meet on a beach that would be so powerful. except nolan has such bad taste in men he'd cast a bunch of uggos
157,"Nolan doesn't seem to understand the definition of the word ""bald"", though, or just didn't have any bald friends."
158,"Criticize all you want, but achieving this level of intensity with his first film is pretty impressive. NOLON MIND-BLOWN."
159,Oh wait what-
160,"What a slick and cunning thief, or should I say murderer?"
161,This is a super solid debut film. Leaves a lot to think about but also creates a fantastic atmosphere that is easy to love even with the uncertainty surrounding what takes place in the film. Perhaps most impressive is how much Nolan is able to pull off with so little.
162,you know he's a writer cause he's got a book titled ENGLISH on his desk.
163,"Nolan likes to play around with time and timelines, and this early example of that just feels so special in my opinion."
164,a nolan film with no michael caine... something's not right here
165,the characters are decent but not fleshed out. definitely had potential.
166,"Back when Warner Bros. wasn't giving Nolan $200,000,000 to blow up planes."
167,"The moderately popular evidence of Nolan before Nolan. A film reminiscent of Hitchcock, Following appears to be the finest a film student makes to finally graduate as a filmmaker. The film is full of clues, and easter eggs for the entire Nolangraphy to come in the future. The make-believe reality, and trustworthy protagonists, end up denying their existence, leaving you with doubt. Following exhibits brilliance in the way it is written and cautions you against conscious voyeurism in an increasingly individualistic world."
168,i love a good microbudget but did anyone tell chris nolan that character personalities are free
169,"a little weird not seeing nolan working with warner bros., and not making a big budget film, but nonetheless this was a great way to showcase his talent for storytelling."
170,"My favorite thing about watching this movie with someone else was simultaneously saying ""oohhh"" when something was explained."
171,"Mostly just wanted to see Nolan's debut before taking a deep dive into his more recent stuff that I've missed. Pretty great for what it was, great precursor to Memento, but worse in every way."
172,"Feels like the plot was disjointed for no other reason than that Nolan saw other filmmakers did it so he should too. It's an admirable effort for a first film, but the whole thing just seems to fall short of being a great film."
173,", which is not only one of Nolan's best and brightest, but also one of the most iconic, important, and impressive films ever made."
174,"Arguably, one of Nolan's best films. I wish (personally) he would've stayed doing small movies like this and ""Memento"""
175,Such an audacious attempt in his debut film.
176,better version
177,but hey i've seen every single Christopher Nolan movie now! I don't love his movies but he's certainly one of the most unique filmmakers working today.
178,Christopher Nolan ranked
179,What I love so much about Nolan is that he constantly pushes the idea of storytelling through film to it's limits. He doesn't settle for the simple way to tell a story. And his directorial debut is no exception
180,"every time the camera cuts to him, so I quite enjoyed this, especially as a (pretty die hard) Nolan fan."
181,(3.25/5)
182,Almost every Nolan movie has that one part that makes you go OHHHHHHHH
183,"This has Nolan using non-linear storytelling for no clear reason (unlike the times he uses it on his future movies), and as such becomes unnecessarly confusing and convoluted, and the characters aren't anything special, but there's some clever dialogue and interesting ideas here, along with surprisingly great moments of cinematography for such a tight budget."
184,"I liked it. Always nice to see where a director came from, especially when I will soon be seeing his latest film at a drive-in where my speakers will explode..."
185,Christoph Nolan Ranked
186,"By far Nolan's weakest, roughest, and least essential film, but it's not a terrible debut feature. Could have been better, but it's understandable, considering that this was shot with basically no budget. The best part about this film is that it showed the potential and promise of Nolan, which he showed in his later films"
187,", despite the rough no-budget atheistic, the final result is an incredibly interesting look at the beginning of a directors career and a very worthwhile watch."
188,"A progenitor for what was to come with Christopher Nolan. All the tropes, styling, moods and design choices are here, from the narrative structure to all of the male characters wearing suits. Only thing I think weighing this down is the film's look: It screams ""Student's First Film"" presentation wise but thankfully, the script is anything but. Now I just need to see Insomnia and I'll be done."
189,Batman Easter Egg.
190,Watched on Criterion Channel
191,"[Commentary Track] It's about as dry and soft spoken as you'd expect from Nolan (give me the dry humor of David Fincher any day), but I'd say it's a pretty valuable track for people looking to make a no-budget film because a lot of what he says is about crafting your script and aesthetic to your budget rather than scrambling to figure out how you're going to get the shots and tone you need given the lack of funds."
192,. nothing profound
193,"Times I audibly said ""oh shit"": 1"
194,Gotta love that there's a Batman logo prominently displayed on the main character's front door.
195,Christopher Nolan Films Ranked
196,"It's so incredible to see where a director's career starts from. You can tell with from the story, the editing, and even the way it's shot that it is a Nolan film. All of the elements explore the roots of Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style. It's almost a depiction of how he makes a film in general. Each element that is in this is used in his later work but is only expanded on until he masters it."
197,"I love how Nolan's tiny little debut film still has all the signature elements that he's become known for. Non-linear storytelling, 3rd act twists, punchy dialogue. Surprisingly still holds up well to this day"
198,"It is pretty much Memento-Test, and as simple as it is, the film still gives us a good and intriguing story. Decent start on Nolan's directorial career."
199,Very very very well done Chris!
200,"The first Christopher Nolan film is also the only Christopher Nolan film I've seen where I sort of believed that some of the characters might, in fact, fuck."
201,Underrated feature film debut that you have to see.
202,Yo have you guys heard how frugal and cost-efficient this bad movie was?
203,if you wanna watch it and it's only 70 minutes long. I greatly enjoyed this film and it definitely shows the genius of Nolan from a young age which will grow much greater later in his filmography.
204,"this is underrated. the plot is good, the actors are good and christopher nolan is still my fave director"
205,"So many of Christopher Nolan's structural and emotional foundations are in their infancy here; the manipulation of time, objects holding our hearts, identity in flux his interests are clear and cemented beautifully. Nolan is without a doubt my favorite major filmmaker working today and I'm so excited to go through his movies again :)"
206,the plot sounded intriguing enough but I was completely confused for the entire runtime
207,"Maybe the quintessential Nolan movie for me; I like the concept with it's closed-loop nature, but I can't quite engross myself in the performances or the dialogue because they are both a little stale. I think he'd be in a better position now to make this now though because he'd surely cast it better and it is an intriguing noir."
208,"Though I think Memento put Nolan on the map, Following is just as good. The story is told through three different points of time which come together at the end to show the big picture of what is going on. It has a small start but by the end, you realize the weight of what just took place."
209,"It has an unusual plot, but somehow it all comes together remarkably well. I truly felt evangel with the dreamy and curious structure. A solid low budget picture that displays plenty of strong future promise."
210,"This incredibly low budget film is loads better than a large majority of his more acclaimed big-budget ""spectacle"" films in my opinion."
211,"Great story, but the the filmmaking felt very amateur. If Nolan remade today this he could make it a lot better."
212,"I'm not really in the mood to get into all the Nolan stuff, you can see a bunch of the themes here in microcosm but i'm neither a fanboy or a hater of his work was more just looking for a short noir from sometime other than the 40s for the sake of the noirvember challenge :)"
213,Geleneksel nolan maratonu
214,Independent filmmaking at it's best..Loved it more than I thought I would.
215,Nolan really been using his tropes since day goddamn 1. What a solid film for a directorial debut.
216,"Nolans low budget triumph! The whole film is handheld and im sure they didn't even use any lighting. Their weapon of choice was a melee(hammer) instead of a gun, and the cast was very small because actors are expensive. You can see that the entire film is made with 1 take and sometimes 2 takes, and they all worked out"
217,The ending was great
218,6.7/10
219,"Christopher Nolan and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Movie"
220,"Luckily, later in his career Nolan was able to disguise his inability to write good, not-so-on-the-nose dialogue with breathtaking spectacle, but here the only thing that really works is the soundtrack, the lead actor and some of the really nice B&W cinematography. The fact that the only female character in this movie is credited simply as ""Blonde"" tells you all you need to know about Nolan's attitude to women in his movies."
221,really just needed to be improved on within all fronts.
222,"En somme, c'est pas mal mais pas fou non plus."
223,You can tell it was his first film... But it's a good start that would later lead to brilliant things
224,i sure hope this nolan guy makes a batman movie in the future
225,"While comparatively basic to the films Christopher Nolan makes now, I have to say I was completely engaged while watching his debut film, Following. It's premise is really creative, and the actors give really good performances. The music fits into certain scenes perfectly, and the twists are really well pulled off, as per usual Nolan. It's just fantastic, and makes the most of its lack of budget. Highly recommend this one, it's really underrated!"

227,More details to come in my full review on YouTube in the coming weeks as I begin reviewing Christopher Nolan's filmography.
228,"There's a Batman symbol on the door and a character named Cobb, so the only logical conclusion is that this is Nolan's way of telling the world that he is actually from the future and traveling backwards through time. HOW COULD WE HAVE MISSED THIS??"
229,)
230,nolan why do you do this to me stop the unrealistic characters and dumb dialogue and the shaky camera and non-linear order and crosscutting and your female characters that do nothing except serve as the motivation for your deep brooding morally-confused male protagonists to monologue about physics or time or morals or something else i dont know and i know this movie isn't blue but please stop making your films blue maybe try another color pallet for once please
231,This is a really solid directorial debut which showcases a lot of best things Nolan uses in his films still today.
232,Can we bring back Alex Haw please ?
233,6/10.
234,probably Nolans actual Inception because my god is this movie a dream that drags on
235,'s first feature showed an awful lot of promise.

237,"Funny how the man who makes some of the world's biggest films started out with such a lo-fi thrill. It's a little light and can't escape that student film aura, but the cinematography and killer minimalist premise is an acceptable compromise."
238,Before the ending I found this movie to be a little convoluted due to the super low budget but it ended up making sense
239,Bravo Nolan
240,Watched on my laptop. Sorry Chris!
241,i find it hard to believe that people would still enjoy this if christopher nolan's name wasn't on it
242,I wish more big filmmakers like him would throw out a modest and intimate project like this every once in a while.
243,"Nolan's first film is, of course, not going to be his finest; yet Following did manage to solidify him as a director-to-watch. He proved he was fantastic at tight filmmaking and the non-linear timeline was, as I am led to believe, reminiscent of his first mainstream film, Memento. A stellar film with interesting dialogue, decent performances - for the most part - and engaging plot development. Some flaws in the action sequences are apparent. But, on such a small budget it's only right to laud Nolan on what he could achieve. Worth checking out because of its short runtime as well."
244,This movie is perfectly fine and feels Nolanesque. It's obviously very low-budget and I'm very glad he could make something that could lead him to be able to make bigger and better things.
245,Ehhhhhh!!!!! This Christopher guy ain't too good with endings is he?
246,"feels somewhat amateurish, but we can already see Christopher Nolan's filmmaking style taking shape in this twisty, pretty competent crime thriller."
247,holy shit
248,"I guess I'll never know, but this is a nifty feature debut."
249,"Following salah satu film yang sederhana dari Christopher Nolan namun memberikan cerita yang tidak akan terlupakan, dan ending yang sama sekali tidak terbayang dari awal."
250,or any of Christopher Nolan's newer films.
251,"Eerily shot in black and white, in his debut feature Following, Nolan successfully creates his own distinctive cinematic world. Impressively acted, ambitious and engaging. The film highlights the emergence of a significant directorial talent with his trademark plot back and forth."
252,All of Nolan's trademarks started from this one.
253,"This was Nolan before he was Nolan, proving that he was always Nolan, which is the most Nolan thing he can do or did."
254,proves he doesn't need a huge budget to tell a great story.
255,all of nolans films feel shorter and this is his shortest k
256,Nolan does Jarmusch does Hitchcock?
257,That Nolan has retained his visual experimentation and playfulness of images within serious material throughout his career is something to be thankful for.
258,"Worth watching and very good considering it's budget, but not something I'm actively going to want to watch again."
259,I'd take this over Interstellar and TDKR any day of the week. Mr. Nolan needs to go back to his roots IMHO.
260,"At 70 some mins its barely a feature but all the Nolanisms are here: twisty narrative, unreliable narrator a great ending."
261,"Although Christopher Nolan would go on to bigger and definitely better things, Following is an impressive debut with good performances, stealthy cinematography, and an intriguing story with intriguing editing. Plus it really looks nice on it's Criterion release. Hopefully, Criterion's new deal with Warner Bros. means we can get one other Nolan notable film in it's catalog....and no it isn't Insomnia."
262,"Finally watched Nolan's first movie, and it didn't disappoint. I actually love how how raw the movie is--you can see Nolan hammering out his style in this, and the story and script is solid. Also, at an hour and ten minutes, it accomplishes quite a lot. Just awesome to see the beginning of a great director."
263,"For a movie costing only about 6 grand, this looked clean and precise. Best of all, it was engaging and interesting. Loved it."
264,"And yes, I am aware that this is an unpopular opinion. Feel free to contest me on it if you have the urge."
265,"The problem with this movie is the fact that it is SO fucking low-budget. Now that doesn't take away from the plot, script or acting, but if they did this in color, MAYBE at the end, cutting back and forth between what he saw (a person) and what other people saw (nobody) with a nice Hans Zimmer score this could've been an easy 5. But it's still amazing, and first movies are mainly just to put your foot in the door."
266,Nolan wasn't only fucking with the timeline but also the duality of characters huh
267,"This isn't exactly Christopher Nolan's best film, but this film did give birth to one of the greatest filmmakers of all time."
268,was a bad movie.
269,5/10
270,When Nolan almost directed adult movies but it backfired....
271,A good movie that is overshadowed only because he perfects this craft later on in his career.
272,MAKE A COBB ORIGIN STORY CHRISTOPHER KINO NOLAN
273,"Concise and smart. Christopher Nolan has a very idiosyncratic way of directing, and you can tell what kind of filmmaker he would become from just this film."
274,Wow. Chris Nolan's first movie and it's got all the Nolan twists and turns that I've come to know and love.
275,"Quite possibly my favorite Nolan film. This film speaks of vision over just about everything, the black and white, use of natural lighting, non-linear progressive plot. With just a tight low budget, Nolan really had to meticulously harness his craft to allow his story to be the told way he intended. Haw is charming yet dark, and Theobald plays perfect as Cobb's counterpart. This film just speaks volumes as Nolan from a directing standpoint. Following laid the groundwork for Nolan's storytelling and shows he's capable of more than just big budgets and sets."
276,The following is my explanation.
277,"Happy 51st birthday to director who give us 11 greatest film in the world, Christopher Edward Nolan."
278,such a film bro flick lol
279,chris you can't really write female characters but god do i love your movies
280,"if i had a nickel for every time christopher nolan made a fun to watch but very confusing film with a main character whos a kind of thief/burglar named cobb i would have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice."
281,Loved the black&white style of this movie and the cinematography from the classic Christopher Nolan.
282,"The female then convinces the Protagonist to get the photos to ensure her safety, which he then tries to do."
283,"A twisty thriller. A nice little nugget, clocking in at only an hour and ten minutes."
284,I swear those two male leads looks the same. I was confused for the first half of the film lol
285,"Some of the dialogues and character interactions felt not that realistic to me and it has all that Nolan crap that I simply do not enjoy. But yeah, If you are a person who enjoyed most of his work, I'll predict that you'll like it as well."
286,Rewatched with Nolan commentary

289,"Is the acting a bit all over the place, or am I way to high to process what I just watched?"
290,"next which, in my opinion, is his masterpiece."

292,"Basically these aged like bagged milk, for me at least, and I do understand why people like this stuff so more power to you man."
293,(2000). I said what I said.
294,Very simple but also extremely thrilling and intriguing.
295,prequel!
296,But! The story was compelling. And the mystery element of it was well executed.
297,"Very much feels like 'My first film', with some clunky dialogue and stiff performances along the way. But the way the wheels spin in this shoestring noir is still quite impressive, and it is fun to see the origin point of some of Nolan's on-going tropes (Femme Fatale!! Ambient Soundscape! Men in Suits!). It's a brief, but satisfying exercise."
298,Memento?
299,"Another example of a Nolan protagonist setting up a ""system"", a method of ordering the world, which then becomes inverted against them. The game of 'harmless stalking' becomes complicated once they are actually interacted with, attempts to know people from the outside thwarted. A quick and interesting lo-fi narrative experiment, albeit a little stilted and constrained (as youd expect with a debut film). Nolan going on to make far more ambitious and refined films, but interesting to see how some of his ideas existed from the start."
300,could run
301,B+
302,Bro the only people who make good films anymore are Nolan and Fincher
303,Although it's short it's a well thought out and atmospheric neo-noir movie. Hard to believe it's Nolan
304,79
305,Greatness from small beginnings
306,Why does Nolan like the name Cobb so much?
307,youtu.be/PA-gumlqqy8
308,Must See For Cinephiles!
309,Top: Christopher Nolan
310,"Not a horrible movie to be honest. It's just a bit choppy with the acting and editing. But other than that, I really enjoyed this movie. Great concept and execution, but doesn't really have much to say."
311,"Honestly, I think this is one of his more impressive movies, and the fact that this was his debut is completely mind-boggling to me. There were many instances where the film could have taken a completely new direction, or an extra hour could have been added without any struggle. However, I am really glad that this film turned out the way it did."
312,Nolan Ranked
313,I assume this is true for all writers that they're constantly following people around to avoid writing. Would explain why it's taking George R. R. Martin nearly a decade to write The Winds of Winter.
314,Pretty amazing how far a budget can stretch when the story is well told!
315,4. A thief named Cobb
316,"nice to see the dna of nolans later films here. clearly his weakest, but only because of the budget. the only problem which the budget cant explain is the ending which was kinda ridiculous. overall tho this was a nice lil banger"
317,"Somehow watching this film managed to be more boring than just flat out doing nothing during lockdown, which I suppose, in a strange way, is an accomplishment. Props, Chris. Truly."
318,"This is a fantastically written, boldly directed crime thriller that simultaneously functions as a character study. The black and white complements beautifully."
319,"It's got solid performances and a good score, but it seems to meander and lose the intrigue it's premise offers."
320,Definitely not quite as good as Nolan's current films but traces of each of his current films can be found here and it's really fascinating to see where he started.
321,"following es la prueba de que si tenes talento, no hay presupuesto ni traba que te frene de hacer un excelente trabajo. btw, nolan sabe perfectamente como terminar peliculas."
322,"Although it definitely comes across as a first feature, Nolan knows his limitations far better than most indie filmmakers do."
323,Film sederhana tentang nguntit orang yang seru dan mengejutkan.
324,Ooooooooooooooo!!
325,Pretty underwhelming idk what I was expecting.
326,"I know this says 1998, but it wasn't released until April 1999. Still counts. Anyway, very solid debut from Christopher Nolan. He clearly shot on a limited budget, but the film actually looks (and sounds) pretty fantastic. It's moody and stylish, but doesn't feel overly self-conscious or precious (impressive for a neo-noir). The narrative twists and turns are maybe a little clumsy, but still clever. It maybe would have been interesting to see what Nolan would have done with an additional 20-25 minutes."
327,"Nolan's first feature is amateurish yet fascinating. There's something so pure about the little neo-noirs that directors make so early in there careers, when they are young and pretentious but captivated by how people interact with eachother in dire situations. Alex Haw's performance is a bit too much, and the dialogue is hit-and-miss, but this is still dark and brooding and fun."
328,YouTube
329,moral of the story? trust nobody not even yourself
330,blah
331,"""Everyone's got a box."""
332,"For a no-budget debut feature, Following is pretty effective, and contains shades of several of Nolan's earlier movies, especially Memento. You can definitely tell it's a no-budget debut, but it's written well, shot as best as could be with only the use of available light, and has a certain charm to it overall."
333,-
334,jokes aside this is a really solid micro budget debut. It showcased a few ideas Nolan expanded on and used much better in later films. The leap in quality from this film to Memento is actually fucking insane and I respect that a lot.
335,Following is the first film of the man who will personify 21st century film-making at it's finest.
336,"I'm very glad I finally got around to seeing this first film from Christopher Nolan. It shows some peaks into the style of story preferences of some of his later films. This is a much smaller movie, a little more like Memento than any of his other works and has a feel of a Hitchcock thriller. I like that this seems to play off of normal human behaviors of people who feel secluded in crowded places. This reminds me of a less fucked up Man Bites Dog."
337,So on my plane from Los Angeles to London all I did was watch this and Twin Peaks and it's safe to say I'm having an existential crisis.
338,"Now that I've gone through all of Christopher Nolan's filmography, I'm probably going to revisit most of his films in the coming weeks, many of which I haven't seen in a few years. Will be interesting to see how they hold up, especially considering that I experienced them right at the start of my film obsession."
339,"is an impressive feature length debut, especially considering its small budget. 70/100"
340,", the magic of successful micro-budget filmmaking hits a soft spot for me, excusing what would otherwise be bigger flaws. But even then, this film's smart, efficient screenplay makes for a great debut."
341,"Misleading title tho, not about the following part at all..."
342,"""Mediocre. I don't know if this Nolan guy's got what it takes to make it big."" - Me in 1998, when I reviewed movies for the newspaper, smoked cigars, and was 1 year old."
343,"In a sense, this is the most inspirational movie ever made. Because if a filmmaker who would go on to make some of the most iconic films of the 21st century, got started with this pretentious, insipid, muddled mess of a movie, then anything's possible."
344,"This had some good direction I noticed, and was interesting at times but then faded back into a slightly controlled mess."
345,"Tense, nonlinear, and intriguing. Nolan becoming Nolan."
346,"Following is very Hitchcockian in that it thrives off long sequences of interesting character interactions, and snappy dialogue. There isn't a whole lot going on, but it's a good character piece and has the level of intricacy that Nolan is quite good at."
347,"Brief, thrilling, and intricate without being over-the-top or unrealistic, but it was completely unnecessary to tell the story out of order, it made it a tiny bit hard to follow."
348,Claire's Film Log: 2015
349,Throughout history will show the real intent of this person and how the follower was involved in a well-designed plan that lets you confused and lost.
350,"What a wild film debut, and I'm not even particularly fond of (or soured towards) Nolan. Turning literally every weakness of no-budget film making into this film's strength Following really nails the Noir genre in a brisk but highly effective way."
351,"This short feature showcases the early potential of a rising director, but is not a great film. The non-linear plot is twisty but the characters are flat; half the blame for that falls on the short runtime, and most of the other half on the acting. ""Following"" may have been a practice run for Nolan's next film ""Memento"", but aspiring filmmakers should give it a watch because he proves that an ambitious story can be told with relatively little money."
352,Would later go in to perfect this with Memento only two years later.
353,The ending is a little out there but still a fun way to go. It's a short movie so it doesn't really drag that much although it is quite slow at times.
354,"A clever, engrossing and enormously well-shot psychological drama/thriller. While not one of the best of Nolan's films, it's still entertaining."
355,"Nolan's stylistic (non-linear narrative, handheld camera, neo-noir darkness) and thematic (obsession, criminality, identity) preferences are already present in this commendable debut."
356,"Proof that you don't need a budget to make a great film, just talent and a great story."
357,Good directorial debut from our good friend Chris Nolan.
358,The noir blueprints for Memento.
359,"It's an interesting little amateur piece with a good story at its heart, but the generally poor performances and some weak dialogue make it rather difficult to enjoy. It's a shame really, had it been handled just a little more professionally it might have made a very strong debut."
360,"The ending made me happy, it made me smile"
361,Demonstrates signs of Nolan's greatest strengths and his greatest weaknesses. Overall pretty fun I guess.
362,Nice Batman easter egg.
363,Last 10 mins changed my opinion about this movie. It was definitely a decent watch. Didn't see that twist coming. Nicely put out. And the screenplay confused me little bit.
364,This movie is about the greatest reverse uno card play of all time
365,This is soooo different from Christopher Nolan's other movies and I love how different it is and how much Nolan's style has changed over the years.
366,A SOLID MOVIE. REALLY IMPRESSIVE DIRECTING DEBUT WITH SUCH A LOW BUDGET
367,Happy Nolan filmography completion to me.
368,"Commentary by Christopher Nolan. Always love to see how directors do so much with little budget, especially now that Nolan is at the level that he's reached."
369,"i've my personal box too, so i'm gonna check it out rn lolll!"
370,"Not too bad for Nolan's first. It felt like a watered-down version of Memento, which coincidentally enough would be his next film so I can see where the inspiration came from. I'm just more impressed that he used a Bolex camera for this film, I am using one in my film class right now and jesus I have so much more respect for Nolan now cuz that camera is DOGshit."
371,"This first outing as a feature film director shows just how early on, in his career, Nolan experimented with narrative structure and time as an essentiel part of his stories. It's a low budget thriller but the thought behind the story and plot is well crafted and so this seemingly unsure directorial debut actually ends up underlining just how sharp and brilliant a storyteller Nolan was even at an early age. Of course it has none of the spectacle or visual splendor of his later work but at the core it is unmistakably Nolanesque and definetely worth checking out."
372,"This feels so much like a student film. Overall it was kinda meh, but it has some really great dialogue and one KILLER opening."
