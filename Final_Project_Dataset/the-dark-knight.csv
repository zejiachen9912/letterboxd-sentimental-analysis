1,the best superhero movie ever made. period
2,has no right to still be this good
3,So cool the joker character
4,"I got really sick of hearing about this movie, it inspired a lot of bad trends, it has a ton of terrible friends, and there's some stuff in there that doesn't work. But you know what? On a whole it's exhilarating and riveting and contains like 800 great scenes."
5,"i'm here to say that heath ledger and only heath ledger is the joker, period."
6,"my friend said Heath was ""okay"" in this so who wants to sign a petition to send her to the north pole"
7,itself.
8,CHRISTOPHER NOLAN + HANS ZIMMER+ HEATH LEDGER+CHRISTIAN BALE= MASTERPIECE
9,so that's what really burned one side of harvey's face
10,cryingggg the way harvey screams RACHEL is so funny every time
11,chris nolan: *sweating* UHHH
12,#harveydentisoverparty
13,say what you want about the joker but in this he both sanitised his hands AND wore face mask so i can definitely say he's more considerate than a lot of people
14,"""That's not exactly what I meant when I said I wanted to inspire people."""
15,look i know this is a boring opinion but this movie rules and hans zimmer and james newton howard went that hard for US
16,i'm a fan of movies i like movies a lot
17,i can't believe jake gyllenhaal's Bean Ass converted heath ledger into the greatest actor of our time
18,"I remember when I went to see this in theaters with my father, I drank a large coke and around 110 minutes in I had to piss hardcore. I stood up and my father looks over and says ""sit down, you don't want to miss a second of this"". He was right obviously, but it was the closest I have ever been to pissing my pants at a movie."
19,what if there was no joker and the hospital just did that
20,a lot of homoerotic tension in this!
21,boxd.it/1tga2d
22,I don't think it would be.
23,Certainly does not dissappoint. I understand now why they called it a game-changer for superhero films.
24,"batman throws a dog off a building, pure cinematic excellence"
25,what. a. masterpiece.
26,Everything has been said
27,the very definition of poetic cinema is casting a man with one of the most defined dimples in history as a character named Harvey Dent
28,Rating: 75/100
29,UGH I MISS HEATH SO MUCH
30,"well-made bush era right-wing propaganda that has aged terribly. seriously, go watch this again and see just how awful bale is as batman, how the harvey dent sub-plot is crammed into the film's fourth act, and how boring the film is every time heath ledger isn't on screen"
31,everyone in this movie is hot
32,Batman does some stuff. Joker does some stuff. Robin still trapped in closet.
33,: i cant live like this
34,"Probably the movie that made me realize that super cool fights aren't the most compelling part of a superhero film. This film molded my ""film-making style"" and I hope to create something at least half as good as this in my lifetime."
35,boxd.it/1w6pK7
36,He got the scars from SOCIETY
37,The minutiae complaints fall to the wayside in light of Nolan's expansive vision and Heath Ledger's serrating effect here. Thirteen years later and Nolan's IMAX sequences are still stone cold stunners and Ledger's Joker is still as blistering and startlingly funny a performance as there's been in any comic book movie that came before and has come after it. The bar was set high with this and not one thing has come close since.
38,I think this is my favourite trilogy of all time alongside the original Star Wars trilogy. I can't think of any other trilogy that I have liked as much as these two.
39,"No film is perfect but The Dark Knight is as close to perfect a comic book movie will ever get. Not one frame is a missed opportunity here. Every shot, every character and every line serves a purpose here. The tie ins at the end are beautiful. The shot composition is brilliant. Heath Ledger is legendary. This is my favorite movie ever because it gave comic book movies a chance to be something more. Something greater than a comic book movie. This transcends the genre and secures Nolan in the position of one of the greatest filmmakers alive today."
40,"alone destroys this entire trilogy by billions of miles if you ask me,"
41,(!)Official Sources Stated That This Is A Scientific Fact Right? Yes
42,for a while
43,I love revisiting this film because it genuinely surprises me each time I do.
44,"We did it y'all we finally reached 1,000 followers! I just wanted to say thank you to everyone single one of you for helping me achieve this goal it means a lot."
45,my mom chose to rewatch this for mother's day we love a filmbro
46,Joker week baby
47,this is better than sex
48,everybody say THANK YOU to christopher nolan for one of the best comic book movie ever made
49,how did heath even do that. what the fuck
50,"an instant 5 star film when heath ledger appeared on screen... i make the rules and it is how it is, folks"
51,The Best Bat-movie?
52,Spotify
53,(Part of the Hulu Academy Award marathon)
54,"I was gonna watch this for April Fools and then give it half a star or something, but after watching I found it to be a severly overrated, boring piece of BAD. So this is my rating."
55,ps. this gave me tenet vibes idk why
56,also me: do not even LOOK at me if you gave the dark knight half a star on letterboxd
57,Our Oeuvre-View: Christopher Nolan series will feature an all-Batman episode next week on Filmspotting.
58,we watched this on the 10 year anniversary of heath's death without realizing it...........i'm sad
59,"forgot to log, we all know it's good"
60,.
61,"The Dark Knight is spectacular and absolutely beautiful. Cinematically, the film is one of the best ever made. Story wise, it both tells the story of a superhero and a crime-ridden city with corrupt people, a love triangle and a tragedy, the corruption of good (""you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain""), but also the goodness of humanity that overrides even our desire for survival. Plus you get Heath Ledger's phenomenal performance and the soundtrack is flawless, thanks to Hans Zimmer's expertise supervision. Overall, The Dark Knight truly is a cinematic masterpiece."
62,Kind of hyped to watch The Dark Knight Rises with the boys.
63,Heath freaking Ledger!!! Review over!!!!
64,"But then I actually watch it, and remember that this is blockbuster filmmaking at its finest. Christopher Nolan is at the top of his game here, and we're all the richer for it."
65,Christopher Nolan Movie Rankings
66,"@letterboxd TDK man-stans, try fighting me in the comments of this one."
67,i'm here to say that heath ledger and only heath ledger is the reason this movie is so brilliant. also can we agree in the fact that it would've been even better without the harvey dent aka two-face subplot they brought into the final act? thank you for my ted talk.
68,Heath Ledger. That's all I have to say.
69,Christopher Nolan Ranked
70,okay they really need to go to therapy like all of them
71,10/10
72,This movie and his legendary will live on forever.
73,I'M DA JOKAH BAYBEEE
74,So much themes. Just lousy with themes. Themes as far as the eye can see.
75,"I love everything about this. It's at the forefront of my Mount Rushmore of personal favourite films, features two of my favourite performances ever and has yet to relinquish the title of one of my all time favourites."
76,From the moment they put the Joker in jail until the end of the movie: Is there a moment in cinema more exciting and thrilling than this?
77,Spotify
78,It's also better. That too.
79,"i remember being twelve and this leaving me completely mind blown after i watched it. seven years later and the dark knight never fails to make me feel like if i was watching it for the first time ever. i hadn't watched this in almost two years so i was doubting about calling it an all time favorite film, but it really is. film bro moment but everything about this is perfect to me. i'm a total wreck right now because i miss heath ledger a lot."
80,"Little baby movies for babies. If this is your favorite movie I got news for you, you are a baby. Oh wait, let me say that so you can understand, Goo goo ga ga you stupid idiot baby. Man, google ""good movie"" and it will show movies that just recently came out due to advertising, but still, you suck. L"
81,Bravo to Nolan and his crew for giving a movie that Batman and Joker truly deserves.
82,"(Also, we live in a society)"
83,yes i watched this again mind ur business
84,the best joker PERIOD
85,is how films shot with imax cameras are meant to be seen.
86,of superhero movies.
87,is so fucking real and letterboxd shouldn't even allow that kind of rating
88,Arguably the best sequel of all time next to The Empire Strikes Back.
89,GOD CHRISTIAN BALE IS SO HOTSHDJDJ
90,The best superhero film OAT. It's also Nolan's best film. Ledger is everything. What more can I say about this masterpiece that hasn't been covered endlessly before. We all know how great this film is compared to its contemporaries.
91,that 5 seconds of Cillian Murphy's appearance >>>>>>>>>>
92,Heath Ledger was really something else. Legend.
93,ever think about all the packs of cards he had to go through to get all those jokers??
94,"One of the greatest movies/sequels/comic book flick ever made - it's phenomenal film making with everything clicking into place - Performances (with Heath Ledger's iconic Joker being the standout), music, editing the whole frickin lot! The Dark Knight puts many films in it's mighty shadow!"
95,sorry marvel but superhero films peaked in 2008
96,i want to marry christian bale
97,heath ledger in a nurse outfit >>>
98,"Save for a few quips and some heads and tails, this movie could have come out now and still killed. What an astonishing achievement."
99,DC Comics Movie Rankings
100,I think what Nolan presents here shows that what DC extended universe provides to us is not even enough as they have better and deeper stories . The dark Knight is one of the few movies that i can describe as a perfect film. I had no issue in this movie . The sound system is very good as in most Nolan movies . i can't add anything to Heath ledger's outstanding performance
101,Like the fourth-best Mission Impossible movie.
102,heath ledger? more like heath legend.
103,... did joe biden ghostwrite these?
104,needed to watch this again after seeing the batman trailer !! still not over that lol anyways this is the best movie ever made
105,I love this. You should love this. Everyone should love this. If you don't love this. Then you should. You should love this. Everyone should love this. I am a man of my word. Everyone should love this. You may ask. Why so serious? Well. Let's put a smile on that face? Shall we. Because you should love this. Everyone should love this. I'll make sure of it. Trust me. I am a man of my word.

113,"I still think this is great, and far from the ultra-serious dirge that its reputation has devolved it into, the tone is pure albeit somewhat lofty comic book pulp noir, never matched since even after lots of attempts."
114,This. I like this

118,"Happy national superhero day to the greatest superhero film, and to the greatest hero."
119,im as in love with this movie as i was the first time i saw it (aka as a twelve year old who loved heath ledger way too much). it means so much to me and im honestly so glad it exists
120,whenever there was a chase scene a voice at the back of my head would sing 'na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na BATMAN'
121,Still a masterpiece though.
122,Weeeeee
123,Iconic. Essential. Bold. Thrilling. Ground-breaking.
124,"This movie is not a lot of fun, but at least it's harrowing."
125,why does it have to be gotham????? why can't we just admit it takes place in nyc and be done with it
126,The greatest hero of ALL TIME vs. the greatest villain of ALL TIME.
127,"Batman finds his true nemesis. (Order vs Chaos). Civilized order is an illusion, a tidy house of cards ready to collapse. Every hero has two faces. There is no goodness without corruption, no order without chaos, and no justice without crime."
128,christian bale your hand in marriage please.
129,That shot of The Joker sticking his head out of the cop car window is surely the greatest cinematic shot of all time.
130,"One of the most compelling dramas in the last decade, and it just so happens to be a Batman film. Even after 10 years it still continues to be one of the most iconic films this century. Everything about this was crafted brilliantly, it was a pure thrill from beginning to end. Not to mention the incredible performance given by the late Heath Ledger, which still has yet to be topped. Happy 10th anniversary to this masterpiece."
131,Gotham on the edge of a nervous breakdown
132,Edit #4: The action in this movie is outstanding.
133,9.5/10
134,R.I.P Heath Ledge you were terrific as the Joker.may you rest in peace.
135,marvel could never make anything this good..... but then again neither can dc
136,It's just that perfect.
137,"Right, now I'm off to replay Batman: Arkham City..."
138,I don't know which Joker is my favourite Heath Ledger Or Joaquin Phoenix. Someone help!.
139,man the joker makes batman look so BORING
140,the joker leaning out of the police car > anything a marvel villain has ever done
141,Bruh we supposed to believe these mfs were fighting over Maggie Gyllenhaal?
142,Ironically I had terrible stomach pains while watching this so when the whole phone in chest exploding thing happened I quickly looked got on Find My IPhone.
143,Hello! My name is Luke! I really like movies! This is one of my favorites! Doesn't that make me so cool and interesting?
144,watched on Blu-ray
145,!
146,the joker is kind of sexy
147,The awesome superhero film by Christopher Nolan which includes incredible acting and practical effects which is about a depressed billionaire in a bat costume tormenting a mentally ill clown.
148,heath ledger's back must have hurt a lot after carrying everything in this film
149,Heath Ledger best joker don't @ me. Cristopher Nolan can even make superhero movies look like perfection. Marvel has the best movies if you compare them to DC but the Nolan trilogy is just on another level especially this one.
150,Such a fantastic film with excellent directing. The Joker is an epic villiam to watch with his exciting schemes. I hope to see this on the big screen one day!
151,4K Blu-Ray
152,if nolan continues to make zimmer use incredibly loud 140db music he may go deaf
153,"Not only did this movie prove that superhero movies can have not only great entertainment value BUT ALSO depth to analyze about it, but it helped me understand how later and some earlier superhero movies where potentially deeper than most would give credit for. Amazing movie as always."
154,.
155,some men just wanna watch the world burn
156,"i will never forgive myself for letting this movie sit on my shelf for two months before watching it, what the hell was i doing"
157,"Bold, Brilliant and peerless.The Dark Knight is the high bench mark of comic book movies that others would love to reach."
158,Got to see this masterpiece in the cinema for the first time today. Blew my mind. The cinematography is sharp and immersive on the big screen. The sound and score is powerful with surround speakers. I want to go back and watch it again right away.
159,"holy crap, I didn't know what I was thinking, this movie is friggen amazing. Watched it last night to make sure I didn't like it but wow, I loved it so much. Heath ledger is perfect as Joker, ofc. All the technical aspects are very well done, and all tha action is super cool."
160,"Narrative, pacing, composition, music, actors, editing - everything is just perfect."
161,"I shit you not, when the Joker and everyone else at the prison started clapping without sound the audience provided its own applause."
162,The Dark Knight.
163,Batman Begins is better
164,"The best superhero film. Truly brilliant action with a genius constant escalation that forces everyone into moral quandaries and hooks me every time. The opening heist is as electric, the scene where Batman has to choose who to save as tragic, and the final speech as inspiring and haunting as the very first time I saw this film opening day 12 years ago on a massive IMAX screen. It was a pivotal moment in my film watching and it remains one of my favorites."
165,filmbros forgive me for not having watched this until now holy shit!!! heath ledger is incredible
166,"""Don't talk like one of them. You're not! Even if you'd like to be. To them, you're just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they don't, they'll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, it's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show you. When the chips are down, these... these civilized people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve."" - The Joker"
167,"A technical masterpiece supported by a terrific narrative and exquisite performances. In respect of superhero films, I don't think this will ever be topped."
168,If more blockbusters were like The Dark Knight the world would be a happier place. This film is incredible. It's smart and uses some of the best batman comic book characters in interesting ways. Heath Ledgers portrayal of The Joker will be in the minds of film fans forever. The soundtrack is fantastic and if you haven't driven around with it playing at night you are honestly missing out.
169,"come on now, this alone is better than all of the marvel films combined"
170,""" He's a silent guardian. A watchful protector. A Dark Knight."" - Lt. James Gordon"

177,It's more than a superhero movie. It is the most perfect movie ever made.
178,Be sure to like and comment.
179,"I just rewatched this a few weeks ago, but I had to give it one more watch. This has got to be the most hype movie ever made and it's just so goddamn compelling. The way the narrative momentum propels itself forward, builds, and finally comes to what is easily one of the very best ending sequences in film history is such a testament to Nolan's abilities as a filmmaker. A masterpiece and, yeah, I've joined the club: it's now in my top 25 of all time."

182,p.s. The Dark Knight is the most watched movie in my life & this is the best superhero movie ever made!
183,*chefs kiss*
184,i hate to say it but maybe the filmbros were right about this one
185,"Pfister is the real MVP, followed by Zimmer. Such a damn shame the whole franchise came to a sudden halt after this."
186,"Zimmer's skin-crawling score makes it clear: this is a horror film about how, when we're confronted with threats we can't comprehend, we destroy ourselves and everything we say we stand for. The ending, at one time cynical, now reads as too optimistic - there's no undoing any of this."
187,"caught myself thinking ""i wish this film was just about the joker"" and um. let it never be said that i have good ideas"
188,heath ledger in that nurse outfit deserved an oscar itself
189,since i'm seeing tenet tomorrow i thought it would be fitting to rewatch this considering it's my favorite nolan film (tied with inception) and god heath ledger's performance never fails to amaze me... it's cited as one of the greatest performances in cinematic history and for good reason. i miss him so much :(
190,bored off my fuckin tits mate

196,"Dad watched Batman Begins for the first time a few days ago, so I watched this one with him. Intense, visceral, and thematically resonant, it's still the best comic book movie ever made. And Heath was the goat; may he rest in peace."
197,"""If you're good at something, never do it for free."" - The Joker"
198,Congrats on 9 Year Anniversary!
199,I never noticed how great the score is for this film. It is integrated so well and enhances every scene. Once again great work Hans Zimmer.
200,p.s. obligatory I love you to heath ledger
201,Edit: Guys I'm totally joking this film is air-tight
202,i ate like 2 meals during this
203,are we about to kiss right now?
204,That is all.
205,i decided to rewatch this masterpiece because heath ledger would've turned 41 today. a legend that will forever be missed.
206,Overall Rating: A+
207,"I just love it so much and I think it is an excellent film. Also, Heath Ledger > Joaquin Phoenix in terms of Joker performances."
208,Batman is the real villain because that scene where he's driving through the tunnel knocking side mirrors off of cars
209,!
210,Heath Ledger gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.
211,i hate to say the word cinema when addressing a really good movie because it sounds so cringe and ridiculous but THIS!! is what you call cinema
212,Just thought I'd say this in case I don't rewatch this one more time near by Birthday
213,heath ledger being flirty with a gyllenhaal sibling cinematic universe
214,Batman Ranked
215,"A dark, grounded, thought-provoking superhero crime drama, The Dark Knight is a truly sublime comic book film that goes places few films of its kind have ever gone beforehand, with gorgeous cinematography, terrific performances (the obvious standout being the late great Heath Ledger's absolutely mind-blowing turn as the villainous Joker), an outstanding musical score, intense and thrilling action sequences, strong storytelling and character development, and a sharp script that pays plenty of respect to the source material while still changing things up in order to keep it all fresh and unique as opposed to differentiating from what's being adapted merely for the sake of it."
216,"Miss you, Heath."
217,.
218,the true best supporting actor is the anti-glare coating on Gary Oldman's glasses though
219,", best performance of all time."
220,"has an account on here now. If you're interested in checking out his thoughts and opinions on movies, head over there and follow him."
221,i'm sorry to every other DC film and batman film in existence but this one takes the top spot
222,the best joker EVER
223,love you heath <3

226,"The darkest of knights, what a great film."
227,"once in tenth grade math class i laughed very loudly at my own joke and this girl turned around and said ""you sound like a desk."" and i think that if anyone had ever shut down the joker and his laughing like that, all of this could have been avoided."
228,And you mean to tell me.. that this film... DIDNT GET A NOMINATION FOR BEST SCORE. THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A FELONY!!!
229,Still find it kind of hard to believe that the best movie about post-9/11 America is THE DARK KNIGHT. (ZERO DARK THIRTY is a close second.)
230,Still holds up as being pretty damn good!

238,"Stay safe, everyone."

241,not enough maggie gyllenhaal
242,i have chills. this was amazing.
243,"Production Designer Nathan Crowley: No it's Gotham, you can tell because I wrote it on the police cars and the buses"

256,I fell asleep but heath is amazing
257,"My biggest issue with the first was the pacing, and this fixes that and then some. In a film with a plethora of outstanding elements, the editing is somehow its greatest strength. Some of the most economical storytelling of Nolan's career."
258,my dad said halfway through the film that jim gordon looked like ned flanders and... bruh i .
259,christopher nolan keep making amazing and unforgettable experiences wow
260,And we all already know this but he deserves to be remembered and recognised no matter what: Heath Ledger was outstanding as the joker. He will always be missed.
261,"But I watched this at a very impressionable age and will always have a soft spot for what felt like my very first Big Boy Serious movie/what will probably remain my most-watched film of all time. Boggles my mind that people are content with still uncritically calling this a masterpiece, though."
262,"I remember when they announced that Heath Ledger would be playing the Joker in this. I thought he was a terrible choice. I was never so happy to be proven wrong in my life. All hail our lord and savior, Christopher Nolan. He sees the light in all and through him all things may achieve greatness. RIP Heath Ledger. You left one hell of an impression on the world."
263,"heath ledger is the BEST joker, and thats a fact backed up by real science"
264,MASTERPIECE.
265,Unmask the vigilante and put a human face on the godlike symbol. Heath Ledger is the epitome of the Joker. Untouchable. Order vs Chaos.
266,"watching nolan movies the way they were intended: in three separate sittings over the course of five days on my phone at the gym. you know, like a true cinephile"

268,me: *goosebumps*
269,"Everything else aside, this might be the only superhero movie to perfect using more than 1 popular villain."
270,the way this has been one of my favorites since i first saw it in theaters when i was literally 7... i will not be taking any sort of criticism for this ever.
271,"for the 50th time, I needed a change of pace."
272,"Still just as much of a massive rush as it was when I saw it in the very same auditorium during its original theatrical run. Massively entertaining on multiple levels, it is made all the more impressive when considering just how incredibly air tight every facet of this thing manages to be."
273,Edgy for 2 year olds. Fucking garbage
274,Overall Score: A+
275,if you turn your feminism off for 152 mins this is a really good movie

278,yeah forever unmatched cbm. this nth rewatch is long overdue. literally do not give a shit if people think this is overrated because it deserves all the hype! hats are off wigs be gone hands are down
279,"p.s. heath, you are so very missed"
280,5/5
281,The Dark Knight is a perfect film. Its been my favourite movie ever since I watched it for the first time 10 years ago. The movie feautres my all time favourite preformance in a film being Heath Ledger as Joker.
282,christian bale needs to do asmr in his batman voice
283,YEP still the (second) greatest movie ever made! Nolan you're a genius.
284,i keep looking up pictures of heath ledger without makeup bc like obvi it's him but he really was the blueprint! rip legend
285,ofc heath ledger is AMAZING and nobody can take that away from him.

292,"""Do you want to know why I use a knife? Guns are too quick. You can't savor all the... little emotions. In... you see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are. So in a way, I know your friends better than you ever did. Would you like to know which of them were cowards?"" - The Joker"
293,i miss him every day
294,"I can't really say anything new about this film, it's a masterpieces and is no doubt a classic that will be remembered for a long time."
295,has made me feel hopeful again though. Hopeful enough that it may help to heal the wounds after Heath Ledger leaving the world too soon.

307,"Saw this opening weekend 3 times. The pros still vastly outweigh the cons 10 years later and it's one of those films you can recommend to anyone, Batman fan or no."
308,a beautiful soul gone too soon. :(
309,but y'all already knew that since i'm the last person on the planet to see this movie lol
310,.
311,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is not only the greatest superhero film ever made, but also one of the 2000's best movies. Heath Ledger's amazing turn as the Joker is unforgettable, and the film's themes of insanity, anarchy, heroism and politics make it entertaining, thrilling, scary, and surprisingly relevant to today's current events. Who would have thought?"
312,"This is my 3rd favorite superhero movie and for good reason this has my favorite superhero and villain in the same movie and heath ledger was amazing in this movie, there was a part of this movie that was a bit boring but every other part of it brought it up a lot"
313,"Christopher Nolan the Father, The Dark Knight the Son and Heath Ledger the Holy Spirit"
314,"The best of Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy, with its fantastic cast all on top form...cracking action, ace score and the late Heath Ledger's oscar winning turn as The Joker...The Dark Knight is pure stone cold class."
315,One of the best movies ever made and one of the most thrilling performances ever on screen by the great Heath Ledger.
316,Outstanding directing and writing too.
317,No wonder I find Heath Ledger's performance to be the best performance of all time. PTSD baby!!!
318,this movie so good my family stood by multiple times to watch
319,"For some time I thought that the only thing that carries this film was THAT performance by Heath Ledger but it's not entirely true. Because that's a very impressive and entertaining thriller with lots of memorable scenes, well-writen screenplay, and all that other bs. When it comes to that performance that i mentioned, it's still one of my favorites, just like the film stays being my favorite from Nolan."
320,The movie that changed everything.
321,"The feeling you get when you watch one of your favourite films once again is so beautiful, as Heath Ledger's performance too!"
322,i love men i think men are amazing
323,I miss Heath Ledger and the incredible acting career that this movie really would've started. He was a star and deserved only the best.
324,"The Dark Knight literally does not have a true weak spot as a movie. The plot is engaging, the direction good, and the acting is amazing too. Of course, one has to mention Heath Ledger as the Joker, absolutely impeccable job, instantly iconic. Love this movie so much"
325,"My dad is so cute, he was watching this for like the fiftieth time and he was like 'geez Mia, I will never stop loving this movie. I will never get sick of watching it.' What a regular film buff, God bless!"
326,Do I even need to say it?
327,me: WHATTA LEGEND
328,not to be dramatic but i hope every person who worked in this movie appreciates the fact that they witnessed one of the best actors doing one of the most legendary performances in movie history
329,... And so on.
330,"is the best superhero movie ever made thanks in part to an iconic performance by Heath Ledger and a shockingly range-y performance by Aaron Eckhart -- two actors who many were NOT initially excited to see selected for their respective roles (me included). The film also manages to strike the perfect balance between real-world grittiness and comic book fun which was a notable flaw in its predecessor. While this film does so many things right, it's Ledger's Joker who absolutely dominates this film with all of his odd ticks, memorable lines and nefarious activities and is THE reason to watch this movie."
331,"The perfect superhero movie. If you disagree, I'll fight you"
332,The second part of the trilogy is the best in the series with its fantastic action scenes & brilliant performances including the late Heath Ledger as The Joker who steals the movie with his unhinged nut job running rings around gotham & Batman. The Dark Knight is pure class & my favourite movie!
