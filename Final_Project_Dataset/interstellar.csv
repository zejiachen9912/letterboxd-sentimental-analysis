1,tell me you wouldn't cry too if your son grows up to be casey affleck
2,"I'm pretty sure no one will EVER come close to being as talented as Hans Zimmer is, also I would kill 10 people just to see this in theaters."
3,When those Zimmer organs kick in *biggest possible chef's kiss*
4,i needed a REALLY good cry
5,HOLY SHIT I AM REALLY NOT OKAY WITH BEING ALIVE RIGHT NOW
6,you know youre #FAMOUS when just the fact that you're randomly in the movie is the Big Twist (@mattdamon)
7,watched on my 13 inch macbook air just as christopher nolan intended <3
8,JESSICA CHASTAIN SAVED US ALL
9,(she also happened to be my mom)
10,christopher nolan should make a superhero movie. imagine how good that would be
11,hahahaha the main menu came on and i started crying what the fuck why is this the saddest movie to ever exist
12,A visionary achievement that I will cherish until I settle down for the long nap.
13,www.littlewhitelies.co.uk/theatrical-reviews/interstellar-28347
14,i hate to sound like a cheesy old white lady but that shit is breathtaking bro
15,fuck you matthew mcconaughey for making me cry
16,And half stupid ass bumbfuck ending dumbass stupid ass what the dumb halo ring human life bull bdkrkfigi
17,this planet were going to be around long enough for jessica chastain to figure out a way to get us all the fuck off of it
18,the best film of the 2010s
19,"Nolan's protagonists have always been obsessed explorers of one form or another. Somehow I don't think I realized until now just how much they're driven by loss, battling the universe's unbending laws forbidding the undoing of a past trauma or mistake."
20,.
21,"Time and space, quantifiable love, the 4th dimension - Nolan's masterpiece and one of the best films of the decade; montage/crosscutting that makes you believe there is, again since the renaissance, a true link between art and science. It reminds me of Jia Zhangke's notes on Godard, Tarkovsky and Eisenstein: that the former two did not go as far as Eisenstein because they only studied art and politics, but failed to study physics and chemistry."
22,Why did they have to go and ruin what could have been a great film!
23,"After watching this film, you will want to downgrade all of the ratings you have ever given on Letterboxd."
24,"obviously, all clashing with nolan's cold precision and construction that attempts to turn scientific theory and very basic existential and emotional ideas of generational mortality into something not just physically tangible but physically achievable. ultimately makes this kind of feel like watching a weird, sad robot man try to algorithmically process the value of humans as deeply frail and emotional beings, which is dramatically misguided maybe but so conceptually moving i can't help but get swept up in it. i feel every corny second of this thing."
25,remember how nasa asked sally ride if 100 tampons was enough for one week in space? anne hathaway goes for like two minutes tops and she wants to fuckin go to planet whatever to chase after a dude she banged ten years ago because women are guided by their emotions and love is all you need
26,"""Fu-gay-zee, fugazi, it's a wozzy it's a woozy."""
27,e) All of the above.
28,how dare this fucking movie make me cry... TWICE
29,"So good in its best sequences, so immensely flawed, over-explained, nonsensical, or insulting in others."
30,ZOOP! THIS MOVIE RUINED MY LIFE
31,Still don't like Inception though
32,stans where you at???
33,my wig flew and is currently orbiting every far corner of space and time with mr mcconaughey
34,It is two and half hours of show and tell I will not put myself through again.
35,The great (unintentional) running joke in Interstellar? It's all about fixing problems with GRAVITY. It succeeds.
36,"Favorite laughable non-spoiler moment: when it turns out there is a dry erase board on the reverse side of a monitor on the spaceship, useful for diagramming ways to avoid black holes."
37,The most jaw dropping part of this is still when Matt Damon shows up
38,"Trotzdem kam heute seltsamerweise ein ""Like-Stern"" hinzu."
39,www.larsenonfilm.com/interstellar
40,science-fiction is the best thing ever
41,"This was not the case, because I was once again left sitting in the theater completely amazed and not knowing what to do or say (for the most part). But I'm not complaining."
42,Patreon
43,*new word?
44,"gshsbdvsv as we were leaving the theatre this guy goes ""one hour of a christopher nolan movie is four years of real time"""
45,Christopher Nolan is a modern cinematic genius.
46,Where do I put all the tears I've been choking on for the past hour.
47,2001: A Space Odyssey with an audio commentary track you can't turn off
48,Happy 1 hour anniversary
49,In space every one can hear your love
50,I WILL NEVER TRUST MATT DAMON FOR AS LONG AS I LIVE. FUCK MATT DAMON !!!
51,"(also: thank you all for 4,000 followers! it really means a lot <3)"
52,it seems that one of my newfound favourite hobbies is translating Michael Caine's lines from this film into English
53,before the end credits even rolled.
54,"."""
55,"hello my name is sree and my hobbies include crying, sobbing, weeping... oh and bawling"
56,"Inception is still his masterpiece but still, this is easily one of the greatest sci-feats i've seen. Thank you once again, Christopher. You're MAGNIFICENT!"
57,I would rather snorkel on the giant wave planet than watch this movie ever again
58,"matthew mcconaughey was indeed that astronaut in the ocean, rolling down the in deep"
59,Most visceral/exciting theater-going experience I've had in maybe ever. IMAX or nothing. Adored Zimmer's score. Loved it.
60,"Better than I remember, idk why but I reaaally enjoyed it this time."

62,he was her fuckign ghost
63,tars
64,sometimes i really do wonder if there is ever going to be another film like this
65,Love is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends time and space.
66,"Interstellar is a grand experience. It's about family, selflessness, sacrifice, the amazing vastness of time and space. Christopher Nolan has on his hands perhaps the third perfect film in his belt, which is incredible considering he should be making movies for years to come, with permission to do whatever he wants, hopefully we can get more stories that explore the existence of humanity, really make us think reasonably and logically about what's next. Overall, Interstellar is one of those masterpieces that only gets better as time goes by and shall be remembered with generations to come."
67,my eyes are WET
68,Nope. Still a masterpiece.
69,"no words, apart from christopher nolan is the best working director alive today."
70,i fell asleep like 6 times
71,and it still has the same astounding impact it had on me upon my first time witnessing it in the theater last November. One of my all-time favorite experiences with a film. I love every second of this beautiful creation.
72,i sad
73,.
74,it's pretty crazy how jessica chastain sacrificed herself for our sins
75,"Alright, astronauts"
76,yet another movie that reinforces the idea that jessica chastain is the only one who can save the world and that matt damon should be just left in space
77,"Equal parts science lesson, metaphysical mumbo-jumbo and emotional manipulation. I loved it."
78,"Really great, liked it more than I remember."
79,i hope christopher nolan and hans zimmer are having a good day.
80,"this is definitely one of my favorite films ever, and who knows, in time it might even become my absolute favorite"

84,heartbreak and pain kick in from these lines!!!!!!! here we fucking go !
85,Matthew thanks for making me cry my eyes out.
86,of Man out of time.
87,"for some reason i never got round to watching this, and i can say that not having experienced the transcendent beauty of this film until now is one of biggest regrets. it breaks and rebuilds your heart in the most unique way and i was completely hypnotised, so to the other 2-5 people in the world who haven't seen it, PLEASE WATCH PLEASE"
88,"is a hugely ambitious sci-fi film from Nolan that doesn't disappoint. An emotional narrative with spectacularly stunning visuals, even if the story is slightly convoluted. This one takes us to infinity and beyond."
89,"Oh, and Casey Affleck's there. Sometimes."
90,We need more movies like Interstellar.
91,The video message scene will never not make me bawl my eyes out. WHAT A MOMENT!!
92,"""Mankind was born on earth. It was never meant to die here."""
93,"I think what Christopher Nolan was trying to say with Interstellar is simple: You either die a Timothee Chalamet, or you live long enough to see yourself become the Casey Affleck"
94,PERFECT IN EVERY WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
95,oh and I also got a 70mm imax film print of Jessica Chastain that came with my bluray...who could ask for more
96,"Remarkably intelligent and undeniably ambitious, Christopher Nolan finds the perfect balance of space thrills and human emotion in the truly brilliant Interstellar."
97,Nolan Ranked
98,That one time where Matt Damon is the most unlikeable character in the movie.
99,Endlessly viewable. Always gets me in the feels. What an ensemble.
100,Nolan
101,3. Interstellar is Christopher Nolan's most complete film to date.
102,Still good though.
103,this is probably the fastest i've ever realized i'm too dumb to understand a movie
104,still stand.)
105,"Interstellar is definitely the most ambitious movie of the 2010s, which doesn't have to mean that it's perfect, there are parts of it that I'm still not sure make a hundred percent sense. Despite this, it is so well done in all its technical components and is so emotionally satisfying that there is no denying its position as a classic of modern cinema."
106,Interstellar (2014) Changed My Life?!?!! *NOT CLICKBAIT*
107,"The Nolan brothers are both extremely talented men in both story telling and visual art. I watched this movie without knowing much about it, I loved the story and the characters in this movie. Great movie but i know i cant wrap my head around the entire movie. But its a must a see!"
108,forgot how this stupid ass space movie ruined my life why would you people do this why why why
109,I MIGHT GO INTERSTELLAR I FEEL LIKE MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY! EVERYBODY SAY THANK YOU CHRISTOPHER NOLAN!
110,A monumental achievement in every department.
111,p.s i too would wait for u matthew mcconaughey <3333
112,Many tears were shed
113,"Preachier than I remember, particularly in the beginning during the world building, but still emotionally powerful and visually stunning. Carried heavily by one of my favorite soundtracks of the past several years."
114,Reevaluation: this rules so hard.
115,Christopher Nolan is a chad.
116,"me, weeping: oh my god.........i'm having feelings again. like some kind of fourteen year old kid. you remember feelings, right?"
117,And let's not forget TARS. Because TARS should be worshipped.
118,"i'll never forget watching this for the first time, at the cinema with my dad. when the credits rolled i was sobbing, distraught, and he went ""people kept unwrapping their sweets loudly, didn't they?"""
119,Nothing gets me believing in the power of cinema quite so much as when Nolan (and Lee Smith) edit the climaxes of two storylines together to knock me flat on my back.
120,The accelerationist-masterpiece mindfuck of the 21st Century
121,14 hours into interstellar and cry and you still got 44 minutes left
122,space and time absolutely terrifies me so this was pretty much almost 3 hours of my stomach doing flips but GOD was that last act worth it !!!
123,"""don't let me leave Murph """
124,so humble for the actors to go to literal space and age over a hundred years old just to shoot this movie <3
125,do you just cry even when it's not time to cry yet because you just know what it's all about and you know it's been him since the beginning and he's gonna save the world and it's tears all over the place even before the movie starts or are you normal?
126,when anne hathaway turns her head away and sighs when michael caine recites that damn dylan thomas poem again #same
127,"Christopher Nolan has this habit of making me think too much. Entertainment shouldn't be quite this complicated, but after the labyrinthian complexity of Inception, this film ups the ante to head-scratching proportions that has left me questioning my intelligence after most of it went over my head. I bet Stephen Hawking loved this. It's bold, brave, mind-boggling and at times bum-numbing, but the visionary imagination on view here is just that. Visually impressive, emotionally engaging, this is a science fiction epic that could prove to be a game changer."
128,". Nolan just doesn't think much of his audience, preferring to have characters literally spell out the themes and detail scientific concepts. It's no surprise this movie is a total failure at evoking any emotional response; it's as warm and inviting as a dentist's office."
129,is breathtaking and heartbreaking. It gets better after each viewing. One of the best sci fi movies of the past decade.
130,"Wow, just fucking wow."
131,that was such an unforgettable experience
132,"A beautiful work. Ambitious and bold and original. The best live action big budget film I've seen all year. Too much (and too poorly written) dialogue in places where no words would have been a better choice, but so be it."
133,Yea.... I totally did not cry
134,is like a really beautiful man that you're inclined to fall for but then you notice he can't spell and that changes everything.
135,The true universal constant is Nolan's love for boring realism.
136,75/100
137,This is so precisely and desperately what I wanted the marriage of Kubrick and Spielberg to feel like
138,Current Favorites
139,"is upon us I guess it's time for me to revisit some Nolan before I see his newest venture. The visuals are absolutely spectacular, easily Nolan's most visually interesting film. It has a lot of heart to it and really makes for one hell of an experience, even just by watching it on a computer I still had the same feeling that I had back in 2014."
140,this movie is cool. chris nolan makes cool films. things get pretty silly at the end of this but whatever it didnt really bother me. i really like the way the robots look in this.
141,BUT THEN...you have most of Nolan's dialogue be a bunch of exposition and a really bad Matt Damon appearance.
142,"My amazement for this film never ceases to grow. One quick thing I picked up on after countless days of thinking about it is not just its metaphor for life, or love but rather in death too, letting that love prosper. We leave the world for our descendants as we enter the next world. Our new home. But our impact and our presence. The love we shared. Transcends time."
143,Bye
144,interstellar takes place in 2021.
145,"""Best Films Of The 10's"""
146,"Yes, I'm absolutely certain of that now."
147,"before that, Nolan and co. has delivered another one of the most breathtakingly spectacular films so far this century."

151,"is truly one of the most beautiful (and confusing) films ever made and i cannot wait to watch this over and over again. i get the nolan hype train now and holy shit, christopher nolan really is a force to be reckoned with."
152,i still cry everytime i watch this movie
153,imagine timothee chalamet growing up to be casey affleck haha lmao
154,Makes me bawl like a baby
155,I seriously pity people who don't even try to enjoy Nolan movies just because he is so popular. They have NO idea what they are missing.
156,also i know its spooky szn and all that jazz so i need to up my game and start watching some scary shiz
157,"I hadn't seen this since its theatrical release, and I'm happy to say that my initial lukewarm read was wrong. This movie FUCKS."
158,THE TARS MY DESTINATION
159,"I think Nolan's movies are okay to look at, I mean, they certainly are pretty. There were some nice space shots in this one but everything just felt very clinical and pristine. Not a lot of emotion in it. At least, I didn't feel it."
160,Those times where you wish you had a secret door in your bookshelf
161,"Still, I loved Interstellar."
162,best movie of all time i think
163,Wow really 0/3 on that one Carrie
164,"Visually arresting, thought-provoking, and emotionally-charged, ""Interstellar"" is a time-bending, wholly immersive cinematic experience that had me floored from the first frame."
165,THIS WILL NEVER GET OLD CHRISTOPHER NOLAN YOUR A GENUIS
166,the interstellar soundtrack could get me through anything
167,"""Because my dad promised me."""
168,i dont even know what to say except christopher nolan i love you please stop making me cry
169,someone punch me in the face
170,y'all wanna know what dreams are made of? cooper and murph meeting when they have the same age
171,"I will save my full thoughts on ""Interstellar"" for a upcoming spoiler review upon further reviewings. However, I can clearly state with confidence that ""Interstellar"" is one of the most mindblowing films I ever had at the cinemas. It is emotionally charged, visually impeccable, thought-provoking, and flawlessly acted. I have minor gripes with it, but what movie is ever fully perfect? From my personal standpoint, ""Interstellar"" is a extraordinary experience."
172,this was made...like...this was an idea in someones head and he just went out and did that...and it changed my life forever...cinema
173,"Also this made me bawl my eyes out, holy shit."
174,"This film really blows its true potential, but I'm willing to forgive most of it because the water planet sequence and its aftermath are so awesome and profound and one of my favorite sequences in film."
175,"name a better duo than chris nolan and hans zimmer, i dARE you"
176,"Hey, nice bolt cutters. Quick question for you: want to pilot a spaceship? Follow-up question: would Tuesday work?"
177,I think he did a fine job this time. Nolan did make an emotional contact finally.
178,the way i will never ever go to space because of this film <3
179,4 years and what feels like several thousand re-watches later and it still manages to blow my mind.
180,full review on Monday morning (11 AM EST) on Little White Lies.
181,"montage and crosscutting like a motherfucker. Still an absolute powerhouse, I hope that I can one day write something substantial about this one."
182,I can respect that there are people who really dislike Nolan films. But if you don't at least like this film... fuck you
183,"I could be very long-winded and wax poetic about how much I love this movie, but all I want to say is Nolan clearly wanted Michael Caine to look like Ridley Scott for some reason and I think more people should be talking about it."
184,I would literally have sex with this movie
185,"(Ik i'm late like 4 years but still wanna write a long review about this, doing it later)"
186,the only genre I care about is space redheads saving the world with heart & hope
187,sorry crisis nolan but having a white man be the villain and a women save the world is the most obvious plot development ever
188,"The more time has gone by, the more I've realized how deeply Interstellar has stuck with me. Simply one of the most ambitious, beautiful, exhilarating movies of this century."
189,"Director Christopher Nolan's masterful sci-fi drama is a feast for the eyes and ears with a (inter)stellar cast -Matthew McConaughey, John Lithgow, Michael Caine, Anne Hathaway, Casey Affleck and Jessica Chastain...a wonderful blockbuster with heart and brains."
190,Interstellar is brilliant and I loved every beautiful second of it.
191,"Overall, Interstellar is a must see. Some truly breathtaking moments and it includes a stellar cast....yeah that was a bad joke. Cheerio!"
192,I will never understand the amount of negative criticism this movie is being put under.
193,watching this for the second time clears so much confusion up and makes it such an amazing movie i just fell in love
194,me: i would fucking die for you
195,fuck u matt damon
196,cant believe matt damon was just playing himself (an asshole) in this film
197,...
198,Great on a second viewing in the little dollar theatre I live close too. Interstellar is probably flawed if examined throughly. I don't care. This movie just sucks me into a different world every time I watch it. It's almost like comfort food. It shows me the world is so much bigger than just me and my problems. It's spectacular. The pure sepctical is just awe inspired. It's facinating and it never died down my interest in its story. And I already knew what happened next. Just wonderful.
199,"While there is the occasional flaw, it's so easy for me to overlook due to the overwhelming feelings throughout and Nolan's signature high paced intensity. Zimmer soundtrack perfect (I think I say that every time for him though) and truly breathtaking at times."
200,oh what i would give to go on a date with TARS
201,well that gave me a good cry
202,Nice to see Cristopher Nolan has graduated from fear of killing his wife to fear of abandoning his children
203,". This is one of the film's best enjoyed when you sit back and admire its beauty, achievements, and dauntless endeavors."
204,"Upping this up to five, why not. As spectacular as Tenet is hilarious. I miss being thrilled by Jessica Chastain."
205,Nolan is (sometimes) a genius.
206,Matthew McConaughey flew with Barney Stinson for SNASA (Secret NASA)
207,"I can see why this is one of his most divisive films, but I'm definitely in the crowd that appreciates it for what it is. One of the most ambitious space movies since Kubrick's 2001."
208,This was such an emotional roller Christopher Nolan you whore i love you
209,"While I always admired Nolan as a filmmaker, I was never moved by his work. This Sci-Fi Epic that's ultimately (and thankfully for me) more about the unbreakable bond between a father and his daughter than about accurate space time travel finally did that, as Nolan chooses unapologetically and for the first time in his career to focus on emotion rather than logic, making this film a truly memorable one that doesn't feel like a cold documentary as I initially and wrongfully thought it would be."
210,honestly i don't think i have breathed properly since seeing this in theatres 4 years ago i love space so fucking much
211,christopher nolan is actually so sexy with his gigantic galaxy brain
212,"Hands down the most beautiful 4K UHD Blu-ray I've seen. I watched the water planet sequence many, many times."
213,trigger warning: an affleck brother
214,my mum learned how to play the interstellar theme on the piano. she didn't know the movie behind the music so we watched it lol
215,society if fathers kept their promises
216,Favorite Soundtracks/Scores List
217,"and at its heart is humanity and love. Its visuals, stunning photography, and crescendoing score aid a script that is not without its faults, but the earnestness of Nolan's overall vision pulls it through."
218,"So, interstellar. It's probably unlike anything you've seen in terms of ambition. It probably shouldn't work. But, it does. It's something remarkable to behold and if you can see it on film stock you should. I can't tell ya much about plot other than it works in the long run though it can be confusing at times. And good lamb it hit all the emotions. I'm not ready to be a father after watching that. Or maybe I am. I don't know. Let me know whatcha think after."
219,Never watching this again for real this time
220,"Whenever Michael Caine talked all I could see was Secret Agent McMissel. I know people say everyone has sins their past self did that they regret, but I never knew what they meant until I heard the familiar voice of that Volvo P1800."
221,Keep it up Christopher Nolan.
222,"Quite possibly Nolan's worst effort to date. An expository load of drivel that has the gumption to continually assault its audience with unnecessary information. If you don't get sick of characters explaining things that make no sense, you'll be bored senseless by the emotionally manipulative score and the ineptitude of the storytelling. ""Disastrous"" doesn't even begin to highlight the movie's lack of restraint."
223,a different experience for sure.
224,we gotta stop sending matt damon into space
225,2014 Films Ranked
226,Alright Alright Alright
227,Hans Zimmer's score is the greatest thing my ears have ever heard. I don't have much else to say except that I now realize this is a perfect film.
228,Christopher Nolan somehow made 2 masterpieces
229,"Love is quantifiable, whaddya know."
230,ive never seen this movie but made out with one of the actors in it
231,"the movie returned to my local theaters and of course i had to go and cry for two hours long,, damn you christopher nolan"
232,me: LOVE! IS! THE! ONE! THING! WE! ARE! CAPABLE! OF! PERCEIVING! THAT! TRANSCENDS! DIMENSIONS! OF! TIME! AND! SPACE!!!!!!
233,"p.s. After 30 years, people will adore this movie. Students will see this movie in school or online class."
234,"Me not liking the movie at all with the first half, but by the end really really liking it, is what I call character development!"
235,back in 2014 none of us knew the reason Cooper was crying was that his son Timothee Chalamet grew up to be Casey Affleck
236,matt damon you dumb bitch
237,WHATEVER CAN HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN MOTHERFUCKERS
238,"The problem with this picture is when Americans think about they're apocalyptic future it's never believable. The power of any sci-fi picture is that at some point you believe, even if it's just for a moment, there is no point in Interstellar that this happens. This movie is just another family first, christian morality played out on a green screen. If it wasn't for the intoxicants and the special effects I would have walked out! Nolan has lost what little he ever had."
239,Can I please have those three hours back now?
240,"I feel like this is Nolan's most ambitious,accomplished and complex movie to date. Dealing with the theory of relativity,wormholes,time and space continuum and event horizons. Matthew McConaughey and Jessica Chastain were the stand outs among the cast,which had a lot more cameos than I was aware of. Can't forget Hans Zimmer's amazing score and Hoyt Van Hoytema's incredible cinematography."
241,Full review here.
242,Seeing this movie in theatres was maaaaybe the coolest thing ever. Also please inject that score into my veins
243,Disappointing review on its way...
244,"also i had no idea matt damon was in this , why is he a constant jump scare"
245,"words cannot describe how much i love this movie, the score, everything about it."
246,also matt damon belongs in space
247,Nothing is more satisfying than seeing scenes that seemed completely insignificant being threaded (masterfully) into the larger narrative. I literally rewatched this two days in a row to experience it again. I love Nolan.
248,God I hate myself for not being into movies back in 2014 and therefore probably watching horrible bosses 2 in the cinema instead of this masterpiece
249,What happens when scientists bump up against things that defy easy characterization and analysis? Things like love? Humanity and the work that we do that we hand from one generation to the next in the hopes that we might survive and maybe even prosper. What it means to be human.
250,ok so i watched this again just for that Movie Facts tweet about the 1.25 second ticks that happen on miller's planet representing a day on earth passing by and boy that was scary!
251,"We've always defined ourselves by the ability to overcome the impossible. And we count these moments. These moments when we dare to aim higher, to break barriers, to reach for the stars, to make the unknown known. We count these moments as our proudest achievements. But we lost all that. Or perhaps we've just forgotten that we are still pioneers. And we've barely begun. And that our greatest accomplishments cannot be behind us, because our destiny lies above us."
252,"Rarely has a movie been so difficult to rate out of 5 stars and comment on. With its incredible visuals, cinematography, practical effects, ambition, and vision comes horrible dialogue, cliched sequences, a typical hollywood ending, weak plot, sentimentality, pandering, several failures during the development to the climax, and those final ten minutes. 'Interstellar' is an extremely ambitious film in terms of scope and its colossal presence is applaudable, the reason it receives a positive score from me."
253,.
254,"Shut the fuck up , please shut the fuck up"
255,"As expansive as it is intimate, Interstellar is an immersive, stirring, soulful, thematically ambitious odyssey with great performances, an impeccable production value and numerous sequences that have refused to leave my thoughts since first viewing."
256,"shattered. that was far, far better than i expected. best sci-fi film i've seen since 2001: a space odyssey, hands down."
257,"Will elaborate on later, but this is an incredibly stupid movie that thinks it's far smarter than is."
258,I could make a joke about how everyone mumbles their lines and people somehow hear them from across the room but I think I will just say thank you Mr. Nolan for making a film that resonates with me so deeply
259,"One second watch, I have grown a much bigger appreciation for this film. While I still feel the film gets too heavy handed with the themes and ideas, this is a visual splendor filled with a fascinating journey. The characters are very compelling and the emotion is through the roof. This is a film I would not be surprised if I enjoy it more upon another rewatch. It is a film I highly recommend."
260,that line where matthew mcconaughey says parents are just here to be memories for their children.... yea
