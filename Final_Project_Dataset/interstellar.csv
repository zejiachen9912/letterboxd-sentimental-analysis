2,"Time and space, quantifiable love, the 4th dimension - Nolan's masterpiece and one of the best films of the decade; montage/crosscutting that makes you believe there is, again since the renaissance, a true link between art and science. It reminds me of Jia Zhangke's notes on Godard, Tarkovsky and Eisenstein: that the former two did not go as far as Eisenstein because they only studied art and politics, but failed to study physics and chemistry."
3,Why did they have to go and ruin what could have been a great film!

5,"obviously, all clashing with nolan's cold precision and construction that attempts to turn scientific theory and very basic existential and emotional ideas of generational mortality into something not just physically tangible but physically achievable. ultimately makes this kind of feel like watching a weird, sad robot man try to algorithmically process the value of humans as deeply frail and emotional beings, which is dramatically misguided maybe but so conceptually moving i can't help but get swept up in it. i feel every corny second of this thing."
