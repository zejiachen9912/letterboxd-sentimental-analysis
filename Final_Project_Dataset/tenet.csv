0,thank you for watching
1,Half the dialogue is exposition. The soundtrack goes BRRRRM. You will forget the entire thing on the drive home. A film by Christopher Nolan.
2,nolan so scared to flop he designed a movie you have to watch twice
3,"also, i really hope whoever goes to see this movie has super hearing, because it is impossible to understand the dialogue for about 70% of this movie over that damn soundtrack."
4,"hilariously expensive, convoluted, and up its own ass. like, sooooo dumb. loved every second of it!"
5,(haha get it it's a palindrome)
6,Let's get real here - Nolan crashes a real airplane in to a building. He deserves to be nominated for that reason alone.
7,the test:
8,p.s. for my fellow Americans: you can privately rent out a Cinemark in certain places for a LOT less than you think and see this or whatever you want with some peace of mind.

10,(i lost)
11,"i give full permission for john david washington, robert pattinson and elizabeth debicki to STEP on me"
12,"when hermione granger said ""you have the emotional range of a teaspoon"" she was talking about this movie"
13,"must a movie make sense? is it not enough to see robert pattinson, huge, in imax?"
14,Saw it in 70mm this time and the bass was so powerful it made the seats vibrate and earned the movie an extra half star
15,on crack.
16,it feels like we only go backwards
17,"from LAX to watch this in the bed of a truck at a drive-in in San Diego, California."
18,solved its dire emotional hook issue by making Neil the protagonist.
19,Doesn't have one. Still pretty rad.
20,the soundtrack: DAAAANUMMmmMMmM DOAAMAASSMMM DUNNANAAADNUMM
21,ALL OF IT!
22,* will have thoughts when I rewatch bc I am still somewhat confused
23,"if this was the cinematic messiah that was supposed to 'save' the theatrical experience from the clutches of COVID, maybe that experience deserves to die. better a noble death at the hands of a killer plague than further allowing nolan to continue to project his juvenile james bond replicas onto celluloid and force the audience at gunpoint to call it 'art'"
24,BAAAAAOAOAOAOAOAOOSOAOAOA
25,just fully weeping with laughter. absolute nonsense. finally someone has made a movie about grad school
26,A serious disappointment and Nolan's weakest since TDKR.
27,cowboy shit.
28,"""Blimey, Nolan has done it again!"""
29,"A masterpiece, for the most part. Seriously what is wrong with you people."
30,- Kenneth Branagh's accent
31,I wanted to reverse all the time I wasted seeing this shit
32,Cinematic hostile architecture. Felt like I was sitting on my keys while watching it. But I respect Nolan's cold contempt for his audience and his reptilian understanding of the nature of wealth. The most English person to ever make a movie.
33,We live in a twilight world.
34,My Head: Skrrt Skrrt...
35,it sucks AND blows
36,Compels me though.
37,"So compulsively rewatchable, Nolan at his most fun. Cowboy Shit."
38,TENET EXPLAINED. WHAT IS TENET ABOUT?
39,this shit rocks
40,": Stop making puzzles for Reddit boards and internet explainers to figure out. Prioritize accessibility, at least a little bit more."
41,RACECAR
42,"ay someone tell me the objective of the third act, I nearly fell asleep"
43,But yea this movie was pretty damn fun
44,"i like to think that at the table read kenneth branagh winked at robert pattinson when he read ""we live in a twilight world"""
45,"Horrible writing all around, but particularly in the attempts (or lack thereof) to give the characters motivation for bothering with any of this."
46,www.larsenonfilm.com/tenet
47,this movie gets right that if someone gave you a secret code word and tells you to use it sparingly you would immediately say the word to everyone you come into contact with
48,"And on a side note, Kenneth Branagh must be stopped at all costs."
49,bold of you to assume that watching Tenet once would be enough for me to understand what the fuck is going on...

51,UPDATE: CLICK HERE TO READ MY FULL REVIEW.
52,nolan was off like 10 percs writing this
53,fruity little r-patz
54,Nolan's most muddled film also just happens to have the most exciting action set pieces you'll ever see on screen.
55,who cares about understanding tenet when you can just stare at john david washington doing cool shit for over two hours
56,watching this confusing ass film with my entire family was literally the funniest experience of my life
57,BWAHHHHHHHHHHHHH DUHHHHHHHHHHHHH MMMMMMMMMM
58,"I'm reviewing this from beyond the grave because Chris Nolan shot me on my way out of the theater for saying it ""wasn't that good."""
59,I risked my health to see this in the theater and neither of the leads reverse-ejaculated :/
60,"of all the mind-blowing things in this film, perhaps the most surreal part about it is hearing Robert Pattinson speak in an English accent again"
61,Bravo fortnite!!!
62,"Who the fuck called this a 'humorless disappointment""? Fuck em. Nolan is a comedic genius, don't ever let anyone tell you otherwise."
63,"hey, chris. you little piss baby. i'm willing to go 1v1 on why watching this on my 70"" tv in my bedroom was a more enjoyable experience than going to the movies."
64,Ass cramp with travis scott in the back straight jammin
65,Vegetarian options available
66,FEEEEEEELLLLLLLTTTTTTT.
67,10/10
68,snoitulos yportne-esrever eriuqer smelborp yportne-esrever
69,ohhhh how great it feels to see hot people on the big screen once again. Nolan came through!!
70,I ordered my hot sauce an hour ago
71,my eardrums will never recover from this
72,: Time is my bitch.
73,I forgot it all immediately
74,Update: Mank won best cinematography and Nomadland won best picture
75,"i didn't understand any of it but it was sexy, so if that's what you were aiming for christopher nolan then congratulations"
76,me and the girls after we get the vaccine
77,"The film that confirms Nolan no longer has any interest in human beings beyond assets on a poster or dots on a diagram... Visually and spiritually grey, it's too terse to relax and have a moment's fun with its premise; it's a caper for shut-ins, which may not stop it from becoming a runaway smash."
78,proud to announce this does not make any more sense with subtitles
79,"if someone put a gun to my head and told me to describe one (1) scene from this film, i would simply die"
80,3.5/5 exceedingly tall women
81,This review may sound overly critical but this is only because Nolan is a remarkable director meaning the positives are self explanatory.
82,"Easily Nolan's most confusing film to date, and perhaps his most complex. A film that you certainly will need to see more than once, especially with subtitles. It's massive, loud, mind-blowing, intense and probably a dozen other things. When the film finished I left my brain on my seat and walked backwards out of the cinema."
83,.
84,"Quick recommendation, if you are not willing to pay attention for the entire runtime avoid it at all costs, you're not going to enjoy this little gem."
85,"something. Because the plot, the characters, the logic nor the sound mixing behind it isn't gonna do that for you."
86,time is literally not real. five stars
87,150 minutes of Christopher Nolan trying to murder my eardrums
88,Nolan should've used the delay time to fix the fucken audio mixing
89,If movie bad... why actors sexy?
90,Sixet
91,Five Stars!
92,"Nolan wants to have sex with time , and we should let him"
93,"Update: Not as fire as Travis led us to believe but also not as bad as everyone is making it out to be. Overall not very fire, but pretty fire"
94,eric buddy my to happened this
95,melbourne and the state of victoria as a whole: are you in the right headspace to receive information that could potentially hurt you?
96,"Anyway, it was neat when the explosions and the people went backwards. But not necessarily in that order."
97,me: yes honey
98,"Tad too hard to follow for this guy, especially without subtitles. Pretty friggen rad score and action though."
99,This movie is so excited to tell you about how it works that it almost doesn't.
100,Who the hell wasn't on Team Edward?
101,FREEPORTS!
102,tenet is only confusing to miserable people i'm having a ball on this bitch
103,"Watched for a second time on my phone, subtitled, and in ten minute spurts so I could go on Reddit and/or Google what I was watching. Honestly the ideal scenario because I think I finally understood *most* of this (didn't even catch the Neil hypocenter moment at the climax during my first watch and honestly have no idea how that fits into the narrative). In fact, the moment I finished this movie this way, I started it again from the top and learned a few more things along the way. Very few modern movies have this level of re-watchability."
104,That bitch T A L L.
105,thing go backwards brrrrrrrrrr
106,I loved this movie but Nolan is so terrible at writing female characters to the point there was more tension between the Protagonist and Robert Pattinson than him and Kat
107,"oh, also, watching with subtitles on is highly recommended!"
108,"I borrowed a truck and drove across town to catch an 11 pm showing at the drive-in, which I haven't been to in a decade; I watched from a lawn chair in the truck's bed with my headphones running through my phone, which was getting FM radio via an app; I brought gatorade zero and coke zero from home, popped popcorn in ziplock bag, but still strapped on my mask and went to the concession stand to get sour skittles: I missed the theater. I went alone."
109,-Nolan 2020
110,The puddle that The Protagonist steps on is deeper than this movie.

112,Tenet is a great movie
113,"Really good, even if it's not Nolan's masterpiece. Feels like a Hideo Kojima film."
114,no thoughts head empty just elizabeth 6'3 debicki
115,ICYMI: I wrote more about this one here.
116,the film that was going to save cinemas is now the one that might have killed them off... wonder how Chris is feeling right now

121,i sat in the hatchback of my little car and laid down and watched this at a drive in with a good friend. i got cold and put my little arms inside my t-shirt. the whole experience made me miss the world. today was Day 190 of quarantine for me. feels lonely!
122,youtu.be/eSLv4_grav4
123,quick question: what was this about?
124,Bechdel fail!
125,Remains just as incredible and unique as the first three viewings. IMAX ratio on the 4K Blu-Ray (out 12/15) does its best to make up for the lack of a larger screen. That score still goes hard as fuck!!

134,"Christopher Nolan, please go back in time and cast Elizabeth Debicki as the renowned crime lord, and Kenneth Branagh as the one-dimensional spouse."
135,"It just feels like the most expensive, joyless and unintentional b-movie ever made."
136,watched in cinema 2020
137,i ordered my hot sauce an hour ago
138,"I thought it was almost arrogantly overlong and Nolan's penchant for writing characters who are difficult to like reared its ugly head again, I felt starved of compelling reasons to feel anything for anyone in it. The acting itself was fine and the action sequences were incredible, but once the credits rolled I couldn't help but feel a little hollow and I suppose, tragically, ambivalent."
139,100th review!
140,my favorite genre is homoeroticism in nolan's films
141,Nolan did 9/11.
142,ROTAS
143,Some incredible visuals and the cast is at the top of their game but I really was more interested in the experience of being in an IMAX theatre than the film itself. Nolan is once again proving he has never spoken to a woman in his life.
144,Optimism makes fools out of the best of us.

146,ashamed to admit I will be watching every single TENET: ENDING EXPLAINED video review that pops up on my feed

148,christopher nolan tried the tiktok inverted filter ONCE and the results were SHOCKING
149,Also film still rocks and makes perfect sense if you watch with subtitles.
150,"Me - (Tom Green Voice) I'm the backwards man, the backwards man, I can run back as fast as you can."
151,no plot. no characters. no time. just really loud vibes.
152,Both brilliant and confusing if you let it.
153,it's like christopher nolan saw how much cinema we were missing in 2020 and made up for it by adding 300% more plot to this
154,ROBERT PATTINSON AND JOHN DAVID WASHINGTON SUPREMACY
155,Christopher Nolan was so focused on telling a confusing story that he forgot to tell a compelling one.

161,starting TENET exactly at 12:29 AM on Sunday November 7th so you hit daylight savings when The Protagonist enters the inverted world
162,what
163,is another intriguing and fascinating film from one of our most audacious filmmakers working within the mainstream system.

167,Tremendously rewatchable.
168,does a film have to make sense? is it not enough for john david washington and robert pattinson to just be boyfriends?
169,What a massive mind bending experience that is overloaded with tremendous amount of information that requires a second viewing to truly enjoy the Phenomenon that is TeneT. It's a must watch.

174,wtf just happened
175,".it of sense make and try can I so just movie the rewatch to want do I and interesting was it ,IDK ?it enjoyed...kinda still I but movie the of most for happening was what idea no had I"
176,i lack the brain capacity to understand this
177,"chris nolan dialogue in every film: person 1 ""oh you haven't heard of the gigantos missilative complex?"" *music with loud steady beats kicks in/gets louder* *person 2 stares* person 1: ""it's when the flashbacks of the odeopolis magmatism ingrained in the sphere of radicalism are turned inside out meaning the tiatamara aka darkness will no longer be able survive"" person 2: ""...so if one was to turn the odeopolis magnetism the other way there would be no way to retrieve it..."" person 1: *takes deep breath* ""exactly..... in other words: this could be nicki minaj's biggest hit"
178,"i think Nolan wrote this one on Crystal Meth. if it does actually make perfect logical sense, i think humanity will need to wait to evolve and rewatch it when we're 5 dimensional hyper beings. kind of understood some of it the first time watched it, but i got lost somewhere in the middle. my brain tried to process this movie, looks like I have to go back in time to watch it again."
179,hyped
180,"TENET brings everything to the table from a Nolan film. From its awe inducing cinematography, breathtaking action sequences, and background score, That's reverse scene's are major highlight. But it's hard to understand. So don't try to understand it.. Just feel it."
181,still a great picture tho!! i wish more movies leaned in to making no sense at all
182,"when the movie started i already had a headache, so by the end i felt like my brain was about to explode. putting that aside, this is movie is still fun on rewatch! dumb, but fun! it does feel a bit like christopher nolan got super high and just mashed all of his previous scripts together. this means it highlights nolan's worst traits: there's no development or emotion about these characters until the very end, and the dialogue is clunky in places. that being said, it also emphasises the traits that have made him so successful: unique concepts, great visuals and a sexy cast."

187,Has crept up to a 4.5/5 on pre-re-watch post Film Junk spoiler discussion.

193,i don't think even nolan knew what he was trying to achieve with this he just wanted to have hot people in his movie and i respect him for that

213,fuck it. five stars. cowboy shit
214,"a goofy and cool movie that's so far up its own ass in the best way - that is, as a film about film not to romanticize the medium and its power, but the delight of its construction for its maker. the half-baked gestures at emotional storytelling of Inception are stripped away here as Nolan zeroes in on tangling and untangling his set of tools/toys for the sake of excitement, which has seemingly allowed him the confidence to branch into some weirder territory (including this collaboration with composer Ludwig Goransson)."
215,Peace and acceleration.
216,Christopher Nolan has entered the Red Room.
217,watched this on a plane thought i was flying backwards for 2 hours but protagoneil got me through it i love my gay besties
218,"Loved the set pieces. John David Washington is great, Pattinson is always tops lately, and it took way too long for me to go ""holy shit that's Kick-Ass"" He's done a few push-ups since Kicking Ass. I definitely need to watch this again plot wise cause either I'm not smart enough to of got what was going on half the time or it was actually Nolans fault and he didn't know what was going on either. Still I had a lot of fun with it and for a 2 1/2 hour film it went by fast."
