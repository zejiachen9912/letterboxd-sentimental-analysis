0,"""Inception,"" at its most basic, is two things. It is a heist film dressed in science fiction conventions; and it is a study of a man trying to free himself from a near-suffocating past. ""Inception,"" at its more complex, is a cerebral pop-masterpiece. It is an enthralling combination of thought-provoking, layered story-telling and sumptuous aesthetics enhanced by near-flawless editing, sound design, effects, and musical score. Driven by a pitch-perfect cast and the confident directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, ""Inception"" is a brilliant and unrivaled piece of filmmaking."
1,cillian murphy: no dad i'm giving up on YOUR dream!
2,christopher nolan spent years writing this movie's complex plot and really named the main character dom cobb
3,Dom Cobb seems like he's never told a joke in his life and has zero friends
4,me: Gay
5,"""The most important emotional thing about the top spinning at the end is that Cobb is not looking at it. He doesn't care."" -Christopher Nolan, Wired interview, December 8, 2010."
6,how is joseph gordon-levitt? is he okay? where is he? is he being taken care of? is he safe? will he ever work again? what is he doing? is his career over? oh how I wish my husband would return from war
7,"WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?"
8,me: I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!
9,living in your head rent free
10,ilysm (i love you scillian murphy)
11,tom hardy????
12,me: i love this gay/lesbian solidarity !!!
13,me with my blu ray copy of inception already in my hand: okay im ready
14,me: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN???? IS HE DREAMING???? DID HE NOT WAKE UP????? WHAT IS THE TRUTH?????? I NEED ANSWERS!!!!!!!!! I CAN'T LIVE LIKE THIS!!!!!!
15,"if christopher nolan ever needs a script for the sequel, my arthur/eames fanfic is ready to go"
16,I tried watching this movie with my dad but he just got mad and left because I wouldn't stop singing the score
17,eames: whom the fuck
18,explaining the rules of the dream world to Ellen Page.
19,jgl sexy
20,"this is what dreams of dreams of dreams of dreams are made of, hey now!!"
21,.
22,snap back to reality
23,way too hot
24,My mom told me not to trust people that don't like this movie.
25,i just cant get you out of my head
26,The fact that 'The King's Speech' won Best Picture over this is laughable.
27,(!!!) UGH I ALWAYS FORGET JUST HOW TRULY EXCELLENT IT IS I'M A SOBBING MESS RIGHT NOW
28,I just think it's really neat.
29,"redeems the action genre by misdirecting from its formulaic bore and still holding up as one of the best of its kind, ten years later. I forgot how unique Christopher Nolan is as a director despite his massive accessibility. His creative talent and ambitious filmmaking are what make his films such an incredible experience to watch in theaters. The Hans Zimmer scores never get old, as well."
30,finally watched inception
31,"My guy Saito makes one phone call and gets a murder charge dropped? Yeah, Leo was definitely dreaming"
32,what I mean: tom hardy is really hot in this movie
33,i think about that a lot
34,"The relationship between dreaming and movies, lucid dreaming and filmmaking. Pretty remarkable and increasingly difficult to not admire in retrospect - how did someone conceive of a cross between Marienbad and James Bond? Also perhaps emphasis on the retrospect - it's hard to imagine a film like this being made in the hyper-corporate climate of studio filmmaking today, and even sadder to realize that this was only nine years ago."
35,I would absolutely love to finish a christopher nolan film without having to go on wikipedia immediately after
36,"Hans Zimmer's ""Time"" is one of the best things ever."
37,again... enjoyed both films alot.
38,"Can someone please stick a needle in me and let me slip into limbo, cause I wanna go build my dream castle"
39,"fellas, is it gay?"
40,simulated catharsis is still catharsis.
41,"academy voters be like ""was really confused when i saw 'written & directed by christopher nolan' at the end....... ur telling me this WASNT little women?? those timelines could've fooled me!"""
42,"Watching this trash film was a toil, and I don't wish to waste additional time writing criticism on it. I will, however, draw attention to DiCaprio's spectacular hair, which is not in any way boring, disjointed, or derivative, or lacking in character development, or a mishmash of Nolan nonsense interspersed with gratuitous violence and gunplay."
43,being stuck in limbo with leonardo dicaprio doesn't seem like a bad idea to me
44,"(the notorious b.i.g. voice) IT WAS ALL A DREAM, CHRISTOPHER NOLAN IS THE MOTHERFUCKING SUPREME"
45,this fr gay as hell
46,"So epic it hurts. I'm willing to gloss over the few plot questions it leaves and just be enveloped by the killer combo of Nolan & Zimmer (whose soundtrack, incidentally, makes *everything* feel epic if you put it on loud enough)."
47,"Edit: one of my favorite endings ever, especially with the score."
48,tom hardy and joseph gordon-levitt... they are FUCKING each other
49,Music by Hans Zimmer. Directed and written by Christopher Nolan. All the actors smashed their rolls. Everything I need
50,"The camera focuses in on Arthur and Eames, over the directors commentary we hear Christopher Nolan speak. ""Two guys chilling in a dream world, five feet apart 'cause they're not gay."""
51,my last brain cell is overheating like my macbook when I play poptropica for too long!!! I still cannot look at a top spinner the same!!!!
52,what is limbo but beach that makes you old
53,The real cobb is nolan and The real inception is happened to us
54,have the brains to create such astonishing satire?
55,"""Edward E. Nigma......Enigma....."""
56,to rewatch
57,I don't know what film those people who call this masterpiece overrated saw but this film definitely gets better the more you rewatch it and watching it with people who haven't seen it before is even better
58,For a tenth anniversary piece. Still just rocks in terms of propulsion. It never stops moving.
59,What about you guys ?
60,www.larsenonfilm.com/inception
61,I need to see Tenet!
62,my hair is not only falling out due to the stress of watching this but also the fact we still haven't had an ellen page/nolan collab since this
63,"is that truly rare, intelligent summer blockbuster packed with ideas and concepts to keep the audience contemplating long after the credits. My favorite Nolan film."
64,Overall Rating: A+
65,nolan be casting his movies like: yeah this should make em horny. drop it
66,what the he-fuck is going on???
67,Yeah.
68,"Yes, it's as good as everyone says. I really wish I saw it in theaters. I wish more blockbusters were like this. Can't wait for Tenet now. The cast has no business being this fine. Thank you for everything, Cillian Murphy."
69,"me, deciding which film to put on while i try to nap on the plane: i'm gonna get real meta with it"
70,arthur: eames this is verbal conversation
71,Christopher Nolan Ranked
72,executive produced by emma thomas (his wife)
73,ending shot had me and dad up off the couch screaming about whether it would topple or not
74,ba dum tss
75,ps ily cillian murphy you're so pretty and i wish i could kiss u and feel your soft skin and play with your silky hair... god im lonely and needy
76,My aunt carol died this morning
77,electric chair [slams gavel]
78,.
79,nolan: yes
80,is Christopher Nolan secretly an employee for pharmaceutical companies because I always seem to get headaches from watching his films
81,Christopher Nolan planted an idea in my mind. that I would love this movie. and I did!
82,So i was ten years old and i decided to watched this movie instead of despicable me iconic
83,"Remember when yusuf flipped the van and then looked back to his passengers and said ""yall see that? hah- oh yea they're asleep, how could they possibly have seen it? Idiot. Once again you have embarrassed yourself in front of the audience, yusuf."" --? Mr. Bean shit."
84,just like cobb I too have marion cotillard living in my head rent free
85,"Ok, this is quite a smart movie for it's mamuschka concept. But the emotional impact is beyond zero. There are massive action sequences, but you just don't care for anybody in the movie - which sadly makes it pretty uninteresting to watch."
86,"mostly had it on as background noise while i read arthur/eames fanfiction from 2010 but it's my letterboxd and i get to choose what counts as ""watching a film"""
87,It's quite excellent!
88,i relate to dom cobb because if marion cotillard was my wife and i lost her id also be so depressed that i could barely emote
89,RTX off: Tenet
90,HERE
91,"I, too, dream about Cillian Murphy"
92,the sexual tension between joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy is stronger and more powerful than a dream within a dream within a dream
93,every day i argue with myself over if this is the stupidest easiest simplest score ever written and how that might actually make it genius
94,"Now, I can hear the dramatic symphony music playing so I should wake up any seco-"
95,"As far as directing the film is concerned, each of its elements cinematography, special effects, sound, score, editing and acting are masterfully achieved."
96,Inception is one of the greatest serve in the history of film no one can change my mind
97,my dad won't speak to me now bc i sang along to the score for the entire duration of the movie those BWAH BWAHHHHs r music 2 my ears
98,Mudkip.
99,"""I WANT A GODDAMN CLOCK!!!...if I had a clock...I would-fuck it..."" -Christopher Nolan probably"
100,Every night when I fall asleep the full duration of this film is streamed into my consciousness. When the movie ends (credits and all) I wake up. I was really confused until 2010 when this movie came out. Neat!
101,"Alright, bumping it up half a star because man the visuals and score of the film are amazing and so appealing. Even the muted colors pop and it's just a blast visually. Some gripes, especially with the script, probably are going to prevent it from getting a full five from me. Oh well."
102,"Total side note, that score was insanely good."
103,"Inception is a brilliant film. Christopher Nolan twists our minds in millions of pieces with this complex film. He knows how to combine true spectacular direction, with symbolic concepts about our perception of reality as how we can trap ourselves in lives and ideas that don't necessarily reflect the reality. Leonardo DiCaprio does a fantastic job. The ""dream world"" dream within' a dream moments and the theory of time slowing are fun mind puzzles to unravel. The action is well paced and suspenseful. The music score and settings all flow together well. Overall, Inception is excellent."
104,"Damn, they must be so well rested."
105,"with a hint of actual intelligence must admit that Inception is, in fact, pretty fucking great."
106,congrats to the first film here to reach 1M!
107,so many thoughts head full
108,BWUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
109,", man?! This week isn't soon enough. A few hours from right now would be more ideal. Like, it would be great if I could just sleep for a few hours and then wake up in the theater as Nolan's latest is beginning. Is that so much to ask?? This goddamn wait feels as if I've been stuck in limbo for 50 years myself. What the shit."
110,Bravo Nolan!
111,"arthur, stacking people on top of each other, tying them together and blowing up a lift to give them the kick: sorry i can't hear you"
112,boy am i ever waiting for a train
113,The Oscar Rewind podcast link
114,And DiCaprio deserves his own franchise at this point.... dude is so good in this.... so is the whole cast
115,10/10
116,leonardo dickaprio out here sleeping on the job smh
117,"I'm sorry I missed your birthday yesterday, Inception, you'll have to forgive me considering the amount of times I've watched you already. We have an understanding, me and you. An arrangement. Honour it. Or you'll become an old man, filled with regret, waiting to die alone."

122,joseph gordon-levitt i am in love with you
123,"Through Inception, Christopher Nolan takes us to explore everything that is achievable in cinema, and beyond."
124,This remains the only Tom Hardy performance where I can understand 100% of his dialogue.
125,There is no longer solution.
126,Everyone wish inception a happy birthday
127,robert fischer please let me hold you and kiss you and take care of you

129,watching this at 1:30 in the morning hits different
130,tom hardy arriving to inception set: i am going to create an environment that is so homoerotic
131,"It tracks that Nolan, just a few years older than me, probably really dug A View to a Kill and it's epic ski scene."
132,jgl hot
133,"do you reckon anyone's told christopher nolan about the arthur/eames phenomenon yet?? and if not, can i be the one to break into his house in the middle of the night and start reading out a coffee shop au while he looks on, presumably enraptured"
134,) being in your four favorites is without a doubt the biggest red flag there is

144,plays in the end fucking give me literal CHILLS
145,"First time I watched this movie I was too young to really appreciate it, but I absolutely love it now. This was so much fun to watch. Also, Cillian Murphy is very underrated and deserves bigger roles."
146,Bitch...!
147,Not too much to say that hasn't been said. I really want to rewatch this.
148,vm.tiktok.com/ZMe2QV5ud/
149,what if we kissed three levels down in ur dreamscape
150,why watch a new movie when i can just rewatch this once a month
151,I don't love as much as my first watch but I still like Inception a lot.
152,so confused but yes agreed
153,must one understand a film? is it not enough to simply be in awe of it and thirst over the lead actors?
154,at the theaters when it came out so i couldn't miss the opportunity to make this my first movie watched in theaters after 249 days and i'll be watching THE DARK FUCKING KNIGHT in a few minutes!!!!!!! you guys don't have idea of how happy i'm right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
155,JOSEPH GORDON LEVITT in a dream in a dream in a dream in a dream
156,"is even halfway as good as this fucking movie, we're in for a goddamn treat."
157,"(Based on that, my new big dream is hack Leo's mind and spend 50 years building a city with him, bye)"
158,"Anyways, play ""Time"" at my funeral, please and thank you. I want all of you weeping."
159,I can relate to Arthur because I too am in love with Eames.
160,). I am indeed crying.
161,Good.
162,you are showing off
163,"as a female in architecture school i really loved ellen page's character because i, too, would ask ZERO questions if leonardo dicaprio approached me and asked me to illegally design worlds for people's dreams"
164,"I discover something new about this film, so I'm pretty sure I will never get tired of it."
165,p.s. u were kinda cute in the 90s when u looked like a depeche mode reject
166,Thanks for reading!
167,review should be up tomorrow night around 9pm
168,christopher nolan please fucking tell me 2020 is just a dream inside a dream
169,This mind bending film certainly lived up to the expectations that I had for it. Tom Hardy and Leonardo Dicaprio are my favourites in this film they both put on great performances. Great action and extremely memorable scenes. Sure some of it may be complex and hard to get your head around but overall inception will be a classic forever.
170,i feel that
171,"When I was an early teen hyped as fuck on this picture I showed it to my mom. Every once in a while I'd catch her in my peripheral vision looking completely wrapped up in the story, eyes laser-focused with a smirk on her face. It seemed as though she was ascending. By the end, I asked what she thought and she said she had zero clue as to what was happening and was just enamored by the sight of Leo and Tom Hardy. Love her lol."
172,"makes the upright, straight-faced professionalism of his characters here feel more palatable. The scene with Tom Hardy telling Joseph Gordon-Levitt to ""dream a little bigger, darling"" is one of those increasingly rare instances where you can see the exact moment someone becomes an A-list movie star."
173,FUCK IT FIVE STARS
174,This must be a dream... right?
175,"We are Hans Zimmer stans first, and humans second."
176,new drinking game: take a shot everytime someone says the word 'subconscious'
177,Anyways inception is cool !
178,LITERALLY NOTHING GETS ME MORE HYPED THAN THAT FUCKING HALLWAY SCENE!!!! YES SPIN AROUND!!! CRAWL ON THE WALL JGL!!!!!
179,i know i'm nine years late but HOLY SHIT
180,"which is gayer, being lgbtq+ or arthur and eames?"
181,"Watched this in school today. I hadn't seen this in nearly three years, so I totally forgot how mindblowingly smart and heartpoudingly intense it is. I'm not gonna write a lot, but I just gotta say that it'll definitely be moving up on my list (along with its younger brother Interstellar). Pure genius. Nolan's aptitude for perfecting heady ideas, narrative momentum, and emotional stakes never fails to astound me. A modern masterpiece that will probably go down as the greatest movie of the past ten years."
182,cillian murphy
183,Christopher Nolan Ranked
184,is just something out of this world.
185,by now it's one of my comfort movies so there is that
186,Christopher Nolan is truly a god when is comes to cinema!
187,"One of the more interesting dreams I've had in my life was when I had to protest Barack Obama's attempts to repossess my long deceased grandmother's house, despite the fact the building itself was in Northern Ireland. There ain't any shit like that in this movie. There is, however, abstraction disguised as subject beholden composition, intellect masquerading as an abundance of words, and corporate malfesance made into the engine of ""pure creation"". Certifiably a film that never improves."
188,was at the airport and being the dramatic b!tch that i am i listened to time by hans zimmer
189,"christopher edward nolan i love you and your wonderful, beautiful, incredible, WILD MIND!"
190,"Some people thought it was too confusing. If anything, I'd wished it was more confusing. It's the perfect organized chaos. Christopher Nolan did a perfect job writing and directing such a convoluted plot into a masterpiece."
191,"Not gonna write much, but yeah this is almost certainly making the top spot of the decade list. Really emotionally resonant and conceptually intriguing to me even after my exposure to art-house and other, more obscure films. The narrative momentum, tension, structure, and music go hand-in-hand to make for one of the most enthralling experiences, and it really blows me away every time."
192,she only refers to cillian as cheekbones
193,"(I'll swear I'll rewatch this and do a better review, it was really visually stunning and the whole concept was seriously great.)"
194,Happy Birthday Christopher Nolan :)
195,"More Tom Berenger in good movies, please!"
196,Inception is brilliant tho
197,And we are all its prisoners.
198,Arthur + Eames walked so Protagoneil could run
199,"Fun, clever, cinematic, it's one of Nolan's best."
200,"""An idea is like a virus. Resilient. Highly contagious. And even the smallest seed of an idea can grow. It can grow to define or destroy you."""
201,if you see me log cillian murphy's entire filmography no you didn't
202,Exposition is fun when it's interesting.
203,"tom hardy calling joseph gordon-levitt darling, that's very pleasant to me."
204,Me: I hope Tenet is better than this
205,I actually had thought of this movie years before it came out. But Nolan just had to extract it from me. My totem is a chewed pencil that my ex left on my desk before she left me for Sven Baker. It still smells like her... And sadness... And Sven....
206,"paprika, is that you?"
207,"Amazing to see and hear on the big ass screen, the wooooommmmmmms even drowned out when Alice fell asleep."
208,joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy are so gay in this movie
209,"my braincells worked so hard today especially now after I rewatched this movie, I'm gonna need a therapy or just a deep sleep with dream within a dream within a dream"
210,This is just a masterpiece of film making. Everything from the score to the acting is outstanding. Could watch it again right now after just watching it.
211,History has just written. It' the first film in Letterboxd that reached 1 million viewers.
212,made me like that one a lot less.
213,it lived up to all the hullabaloo... letterboxd users you win this round
214,c u f e
215,here
216,"This film still holds up today for so many reasons. I wanna talk about probably my favorite part of the film and that has to be the action. This movie has beautiful editing, special effects, and much more. It has a great and interesting story that is entertaining the whole way. Along with, great characters, great actors, and perfect casting choice. The end of this film has such a strong feeling to it you can easily connect to it and how the characters are feeling. 10/10. Must watch."
217,STFU NO WHAt IM NOT OKAY. SO DID HE NOT WAKE UP IS HE LOST IN HIS MIND FOREVER IM NOT OKAH WHAG THE FUCK
218,watched this for the first time on my birthday back in july and was sorta mehhh on it back then but i decided to rewatch it tonight and totally understood it more and WOW ok christopher nolan really snapped
219,no i did not rewatch i just wanted to say that spotify wrapped said that time by hans zimmer was my 2nd top song
220,this is not something they made... like this is some professional shit!! like this shit is in different areas man... what the fuck!
221,2) mal is the most annoying character
222,"Please... Play ""Time"" by Hans Zimmer at my funeral... Which is right now, because Nolan just killed me."
223,perfect movie that I saw 4 times in theaters and my parents got so mad
224,The coolest therapy session of all time.
225,Bro Nolan hates his wife
226,"Wow, the first time I watched this was 4 years ago. I can't believe it has been so long. I wasn't really impressed by it, probably due to the high expectations I had. This time around, I think I liked it more and found the dream bending experience more impressive than my first time viewing, but I still need to give this another go."
227,and they were dreammates
228,"I cannot stop mentioning how incredibly well this movie is written, produced, acted, shot and scored. It is a master piece! This is the kind of flick that you sit down and let it overwhelm you with it's greatness. It is a must watch! Bravo!"
229,100%
230,movie ending.
231,"Well, this was a lot better than I remembered. One of those films where it actually feels like you've been through an absolutely, unbelievably epic journey when the credits start rolling."
232,"okay, those that know me will know that i adore chris nolan and he's my second favourite director of all time, which is why i wish i understooor this, literally i'm confused from the opening scene, and rewatching it doesn't help me, can anyone help?"
233,wow lots of this movie is a bunch of explaining
234,"the acting is fantastic, the cinematography is fantastic, the cast is fantastic, I guess that's what's to be expected from a film with cillian murphy, tom hardy and leo dicaprio they really are the holy trinity c'mon guys"
235,*plays Time for the 100000th time*
236,The visuals were amazing and the storyline was really cool
237,if joseph gordon-levitt asked me for a kiss out of the blue i would also happily oblige and do it with no hesitations
238,post nolan film headaches are the best kind of headaches
239,Happy New Year (soon) everyone! :)
240,HANS ZIMMER DIDN'T HAVE TO GO SO HARD FOR THIS SCORE FUCK

242,i think joSeph gordon levitt is pretty neat
243,Christopher Nolan Ranked
244,I love everything and every single second of this breathtaking movie.
245,I was drawing while finishing this and at one point I looked up and saw Saito with his mouth like on something (he was taking the pin out of a grenade) and for a split second I honestly thought he had stopped to eat a fucking sandwich
246,(School really does be taking up my time smh)
247,If you don't like this movie then I hate you.
248,Inception.
249,even after watching this so many times
250,I would like to thank the costume department for joseph gordon levitt's pants
251,"Not bad. I don't fully understand why they had a scene of Tom Hardy saying the n-word. Maybe I will after another rewatch, but for now, I have to remove half a star from it for doing that."
252,the feeling that i get from the end of this movie is actually indescribable like i can't even put it into words it gets me every single time
253,i just want to live inside christopher nolan's mind how the fuck does he come up with things like this
254,my brain is MUSH.
255,patrocinado pelo sindiarquitetos
256,Satisfied with the result
257,director
258,"nolan didnt have to go this hard but he DID and that, ladies, is why we stan"
259,i was thinking about how much i hate int*rst*llar earlier so i watched this and now i've calmed down also i'm bald
260,"It's own kind of masterpiece. Seen it 6 times now. Could watch it anytime, it triggers all my emotions. The best modern classic of the new decade."
261,hans zimmer really went for it on the keyboard
262,rewatching this for the plot... the plot being cillian murphy

271,The spinning top wobbles.
272,cast to be hot huh??
273,Am I dreaming or is this film actually THAT good?
274,me pretending like i understood this: wow what a masterpiece!
275,Hans Zimmer is THE man
276,"Christopher Nolan: ""You must not be afraid to dream a little bigger darling."
277,Christopher Nolan think loud mean excite and like to explain with big word for 90 min no stop but then the really inceptiony stuff starts going down and in the end is game changer I like rrrrrr
278,EDIT: Still a phenomenal movie despite characters running around and throwing projectiles at the screen.
279,The real question is... Did it stop spinning at the end?
280,"No I do not have issues with this film because I'm not an arrogant teenager with ""fully formed opinions"", and nor am I in my misery-addicted and hateful 40s."

294,"p.s. ""time"" is the greatest piece of music ever crafted"
295,"Christopher Nolan is THE expert in grandiose, luxurious blockbusters."
296,a perfect film.
297,the plot: robert fischer
298,way to watch Inception is via the in-game big screen in Fortnite.
299,Woah. What a great story.
300,"Despite it being 85 percent exposition I still enjoy every bit of it. It's so intricate. Would have worked better as a novel than a film for the layers (literally) he was going for. Don't get me wrong, it's beautiful to look at and highly envisioned, it's just hard not to wish Nolan could make these real and vivid worlds with real and vivid characters. Probably will rewatch again soon with some sort of analysis. We'll see if I can stomach the plot-talk. Also I always forget Tom Hardy is in this. God bless him."
301,i also dream about cillian murphy

312,"Architecture, mazes, Penrose stairs, dream-time vs real time... my left brain had a blast with this movie! The logical side tried to find flaws but couldn't. Well-filmed, pretty airtight, and with a solid cast. It's been a long time since I've watched a sci-fi gem like that."
313,"Another Nolan masterpiece, great acting, action, story...Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic."
314,I especially liked the altered-gravity fight scenes.
315,It makes too much sense that Christopher Nolan's idea of a dreamscape is just different versions of a Michael Mann movie
316,my attention span wasnt cooperating but my grandma says tom hardy is awesome and she gives this 4 stars
317,"I'm going to be thinking about the ending of this movie for a long time, but all I know is that this film is one of the best films I've ever seen."
