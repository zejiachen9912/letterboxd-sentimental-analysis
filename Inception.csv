0,maddie,i think i need to pay attention to really understand this movie but i have failed twice now. i can tell you two things: cillian murphy looked hot and hans zimmer is fucking incredible
1,Ibuprofen,Toxic relationships truly follow you everywhere.
2,astuc18,Nolan fanboy bias
3,yagamemes,"so based, only saw it like 6 months ago and loved it so much"
4,Alex,"I think this is Nolan's strongest film, balancing both a difficult, complex science fiction concept and developing a poignant tale of loss and forgiveness. My favorite interpretation of this movie is that Mal is a ghost, haunting Dom from dream to dream, and he can't even escape into another person's mind."
5,Claire,Hans Zimmer>>>>
6,Snachoo,wacky
7,amber,joseph gordon-levitt
8,Sophia G,"deep as a shallow end of the pool, but the shallow end is fun"
9,GeorgeAmmerlaan,I bloody love the music by Hans Zimmer
10,abbylogsdon,this movie will always be a staple of mine. also cillian murphy? enough said.
11,wendelsic,mano kkkkk
12,Yavuz Selim Çakır,Everything is so perfect in this movie. Masterpiece.
13,searchers97,I finally saw it. I like the hotel hallway shot. I like to think about it every now and then because of how well choreographed it is
14,mariana,"i'm still trying to decide if i'd like someone to decide to infiltrate my own subconscious. but i know if the person were tom hardy, obviously the answer is YES."
15,Tuçe Sarı,Bu ekiple her ruyaya dalarim.
16,Ini,YUP. Instant favorite.
17,Georgia,"everyone likes this movie, it's too fucking long for me."
18,owengroves,Class
19,hilda rosell,i use this movie as tinder
20,Dylan Hrivnak,This would make a great Call of Duty.
21,blimeyslimey,Is this a dream? Is this a dream? Is this a dream? THEN WHAT IS A DREAM
22,moviecee,Good but Long. Not a good rewatch candidate.
23,Ingat guys,Ingat guys
24,Maddie,The cinematography was fucking beautiful holy shit
25,nealgoogs,Confusing first time around. But made sense second time.
26,J,a lot easier to understand than i thought
27,Vago_Aprecio,Normalmente no me gustan los finales abiertos pero este en particular termina siendo genial.
28,Junorune,Cool ass film
29,lu,eames and arthur my favorite boyfriends <3
30,valocity,dream heist!!!!!! didn't give a shit about cobb though I hope he gets better soon
31,Jamespayne61,Incredible
32,BamBoozled123,"Nolan at his most comfortable. From visuals to story, this is the definition of a modern sci-fi masterpiece."
33,🪐,tom hardy and cillian murphy in a movie together? you have my complete attention
34,v,what the fuck
35,Fractals,100 / 100
36,Ashwin,A Kick!!
37,JackJ1234,"This may be my favorite Nolan film of all time. The cast is incredible, the story is great, and Zimmer has yet again out done himself on the score. Just a masterpiece of a film."
38,Liam Crawford,"Folding streets, a spinning corridor, messing with time and dreams, Nolan, DiCaprio, Zimmer. C'mon this is a five star film."
39,247,"A perfect movie. ""Figure it out yourself"" endings are the worst, normally. But it was perfect for this movie. Time travel is usually the worst, but this movie did it perfectly."
40,Travis Bickle,Cool movie.
41,emmy,"good film, figured it out easy tho"
42,kubredi,Really fun film. You do have to kinda glaze over certain aspects and rules to truly enjoy it though. Cillian Murphy is amazing
43,anj (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ,usto q rin managinip kasama c crush xd
44,reinb0wdaschw4g,i dont understand like 20% of this movie but i do know that this is one of the best concepts for a movie ever
45,L,good soup
46,sierrabasco,Joseph mf Gordon-levitt
47,Jericho,"masterpiece, the plot is unique, Christoper Nolan is one of the best directors out there, Leo is such a great actor, he never dissapoints with his film choices, my only regret is that i never got to see this movie in theaters"
48,movielistvalee,Also is the amazing Leonardo DiCaprio here soooo
49,rowan,this shit sucks
50,LJF25911,Loved this movie definitely one of my favourites
51,Richard Díaz,I feel like this movie just gets better with time.
52,GBob,"Not my sort of thing, it was ok."
53,Charles Long,(Somehow missed this gem the last 23 viewings)
54,07 Nov 2021,Still rips 11 years later
55,wellokiguess,"I used to say that I hated this movie bc it was overhyped and ripped off Paprika, but after rewatching it several years later, and after getting much more into film appreciation than I was when it was first released, I take most of it back. It did steal a lot of ideas and imagery from Paprika, but at least Nolan supposedly admitted where the inspiration came from, and then did a damn good job in creating what is in fact a very good movie. Paprika is still better, but I just can't bring myself to be as contrarian against Inception as I used to be."
56,Ashton,"Cool concept, corny acting and cliche lines."
57,nickmountain,Really long but it has Leonardo DiCaprio.
58,León Mayen,Lio
59,imagine567,Nolan deserves an award on that ending alone
60,HuckDizz,Incredible cast. Incredible tense atmosphere.
61,cass,what
62,JulianM8,Space and time go *warp*
63,umadaniel4,good soup
64,Emma 🎅🏼,"Cillian Murphy , Leonardo Di Caprio and Tom Hardy what more could you possibly ask for?"
65,mosesli12,I watch this once a quarter
66,Kyle,slowed down) is used much more often and to greater effect.
67,hiraetheq,loved the plot but I would liked it more if the characters were more complex and the realtionships between them more amplified.the exposition was in some ways disappointing in contrast with the intelligent donouement that was kind of thought provoking. another thing I want to mention is that I believe that the whole aesthetic and all the visuals could've been smarter created.
68,cldtdy,I wanna go back to when everyone parodied this on YouTube
69,jenna <3,a perfect film.
70,ㅋ,the plot: *Cillian Murphy*
71,meghana,I think I forgot to review this right after watching it cause I was still stunned
72,jlmears,Technically incredible. But I'm still not sure I am smart enough to understand this movie.
73,Lili,The visuals were amazing and the storyline was really cool
74,Maritony,christopher nolan's movies always challenge my not so functional brain cells lol
75,graysonity,"Truly, a Christopher Nolan's film that went down on history and is a masterpiece."
76,Matias Pepa,se meten en mi cabeza y aparece chespirito
77,Petacho,"Le meilleur nolan... Comment des gens n'ont pas compris ce film, TOUT EST EXPLIQUE PENDANT LA PREMIERE HEURE"
78,hellomerio,"glad i finally watched it so i get where all the praise is from, but i'll admit im a bit disappointed. for a film with such a great concept, the exploration into that concept is not as in depth as i would have liked. i do think the pacing is very well done with it being 2 1/2 hours, but i'll admit this movie didn't click with me as much as i hoped."
79,adsaddieaddie,Obsessed
80,adib !!,um so this is really good but i am still confused
81,JackiesBadTakes,"Hilariously, I fell asleep and dreamt of a better movie. This isn't even a joke review, this actually happened."
82,buffalo,"Been watching a lot of Nolan films after being completely obsessed with Tenet. This one was absolutely great. Nolan's classic ""fuck with one rule of our reality and make an amazing action heist movie out of it for 2 and a half hours"" is great here, as always."
83,notedp,"A welcome mind fuck, excellent score and thought provoking"

99,Josh,Chills every time
100,betha1234,"Pretty long but good action scenes, some of that shit had me on edge. I still don't get the ending on the 3rd watch. It could def have been edited down on time tho"
101,Marshall B.,I always get super tired whenever I see ppl sleep in movies lmao so I was fighting sleep during this damn movie hahahaha
102,jules,this movie made me actually think
103,kyle wasylowich,Cobb vs Freddy

105,BPJandPBandJ,After a second watch it definitely is where it belongs on my top 100 list
106,goblin7,Limbo sounds wild
107,vytautemorkut,What I personally loved is how the beginning and the closing scenes collided. These particular shots made a whole film seem like a magical never-ending dream/scene.
108,The7works,"Great movie, lots of stuff to dissect about the film, and this film could be watched endlessly without it getting boring or stale."
109,Benzy,I have a crush on Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Cillian Murphy
110,allpeace,Best Christopher Nolan movie IMO.
111,Arturo Spyro Moreno Lopez,Gotta love that Piz Gloria inspired set piece.
112,Hagen Jensen,Just an absolute spectacle. Still holds up 100% even 11 years later.

118,may,if i had a totem it would be a pink taser that only works in real life
119,LIA 🕊,"Watched it again after a really long time and it's still as confusing. Tom Hardy looks as good as ever, and oh what a talented man Hans Zimmer is."
120,luke,"Don't let edgy kinophiles fool you, Christopher Nolan is a master of his craft, his defining brand of so-called ""art house blockbusters"" are capable of being equal parts thrilling, visually stunning and emotionally potent - the latter of which is no more clear than in Inception."
121,andreasrvu,high quality.
122,Iris,this movie was fucking incredible between the visuals and concept and aaaaaah i really want to rewatch soon it was great!
123,jude,robert fischer the first hot billionaire
124,Nirbhay Sastry,"At First When I Heard About This Film,I Was Only Interested In It Because It Was Made By The Director Of Batman Begins And The Dark Knight Christopher Nolan.But When I Saw This Film On July 31st 2010,I Was Enthralled By The Concept Of Dreams Within Dreams! Wow! And The Devine Team Of Christopher Nolan,Hans Zimmer And Wally Pfister Were Again At Peak In This Film With The Direction, Background Scoring And Cinematography. From Start To End This Film Was A Masterpiece."
125,Shockd,Wow. Another amazing Christopher Nolan film.

133,lainpilled69,very good but why does leonardo dicaprio never have a happy romance in a single movie like his wife always dies every time
134,Esme,Hot cast
135,JamesHardenMVP,"What an insane movie. Not really sure what happened to be honest but the performances and cinematography was great. Definitely needs a revisit to really appreciate it but I can see why it so loved. Loved the cast with Leo, cillian Murphy and Tom hardy."
136,kuhliejr,daddy
137,Bella,Ariadne is so cool I really want Christopher Nolan to work with Elliot Page again!
138,05 Nov 2021,The centre cannot hold.
139,Benedict Crumpledink,What a giant donkey queef of a movie. A religious sermon by OJ Simpson is more tolerable.
140,Marit,kind of gay isnt it?? could appreciate it
141,Ashiko,let's all thank christopher nolan for the prettiest cast
142,india,tom hardy and cillian murphy marry me challenge
143,mysteryfilm,"Tom Hardy is hot. Its cool its like a Hollywood film and its a semi original story, failed to engage me though."
144,Santiperucca,Nolan you pretentious little fucker
145,TicTacTova,"Kind of amazed that this movie essentially changed the public's conception of what the word ""inception"" even means, thus missing the theme of the movie. ""Inception,"" at least for a while, came to mean 'a thing within a thing' referring to the nested dreams, when in reality (lol) it means 'the start of something.' Usually an activity or institution, but in this case, belief. Inception of belief. Where belief comes from. How a single belief can destroy your life and/or the lives of others."
146,Marina,Nolan really snapped with this one ngl
147,scott,we love to see trans masc love on screen
148,rninski,Still bangs

157,what was the deal with joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy's characters,what was the deal with joseph gordon-levitt and tom hardy's characters
158,Zo,Confusing to the point of satisfaction when everything clicked. Nolan is at some of his best with practical effects that please the eye.

199,tofusmofu,"it's been 11 years and this movie still such a mindfuck. a very simple concept, but the nonlinear yet brilliant storytelling, the way the ensemble cast played off one another, the score, just EVERYTHING, adds layers of complexity that'll probably keep me up thinking about it all night. i mean, eventually i'd fall asleep, but then i'd start thinking about it in my dreams. and then in my dream i'd fall asleep, and start thinking about it in that dream. and then-- wait a minute..."

268,Ian Knight,"I hadn't watched this movie ever until now and I just have to say, it is amazing. As a first-timer to this movie, at first it was a very confusing story and hard to follow. But after getting more emotionally and overall invested into the film, I felt like I was a part of every level. I am so glad one of my best friends made me watch this, 110% worth it!"
269,ari,"forever grateful to nolan for putting tom hardy, jgl and cillian murphy in one movie"

294,nayla,whatever that means i guess also cillian murphy hot
295,Pipe11,sou mt fa do dicaprio e aqui n foi diferente
296,alina,"Nolan is so good with introduction in all his movies but it is god tier in this one. In first ten minutes, you know enough rules to understand but you have still enough question to keep you on track and you seen enough action to not getting bored. That way he can still even keep normal audience. He is seriously so good editing and passing. And this film is his masterpiece in that era."
297,adashofnirvana,Cannot even begin to comprehend how Mr. Nolan's mind comes up with intricate ideas like these. That and Mr. Saito is the real MVP of this movie.
298,kristab3l,the most perfect cast ever

307,Honjia Koolhaas,Amazing
308,Thomas Koetting,Why does Christopher Nolan just do it better? If anybody else did this it'd be too ambitious and poorly executed but Nolan just takes these mind-bending concepts and makes them work so well.
309,lili,a banger
310,TheReaLudoz,Mamma mia Nolan sei un sopravvalutato
311,Garrett Zavaglia,B+
312,Jake Wells,"The most uninspired delivery of this concept imaginable, made only worse by its fans patting themselves on the back because they think nobody else understands it but them and the open ending is definitely a stroke of genius and not a lazy, cheap non committal way of closing the film."
313,ellps,hope nothing goes wrong
314,Gagostoso,Nolan
315,MrMatty1,"I really enjoyed this movie, I was a little hesitant at first, but this film was SO Much more better than Dunkirk, the acting is great, the speical effects are AMAZING, and the way it was directed is amazing, 10/10."
316,kaipeng0113,Groundbreaking and mind blowing
317,bigdmoviefan,"Nolan left me really impressed on this one, being an interesting concept that respects it's rules to the point. This movie can be a mindfuck sometimes, but it's a very good mindfuck."

325,BrandtsCorner,Christopher Nolan is the Michael Bay for film nerds
326,em,changed the trajectory of my life forever.
327,RiaChatz,christopher nolan has this terrible habit of making really cool and interesting blockbusters and then having the characters speak as if they are written by a 10 year old and also severely sexually repressed
328,Louise,leonardo di caprio? joseph gordon-levitt?? and tom hardy???? all in the same movie???

382,JohnTVU,eames best character
383,LilNeigh,Idk man I was 7
384,bincha,this movie tastes like metallic ass. not necessarily bad but you know some guy named aidan raved about it like it was the holy fuckin grail. it gets to a point where the audience are literally doing brain workouts just to keep up with the plot and surely you could've been like. a little bit nicer maybe chrissy nols? ending was really good tho. the street doing a backflip on itself was cool but i can do a backflip on a trampoline so you know we're pretty much equally as cool.
