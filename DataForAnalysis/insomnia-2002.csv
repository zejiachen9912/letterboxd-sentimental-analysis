27,★★★★½,I really enjoyed this film. This isn't like Nolan's usual work but it's strong. I like his subtle approach. All the acting is top notch especially from Pacino & Williams. I loved when they shared the screen together. My favorite aspect from this film is the script. I loved loved loved the story. Very unique & I wish I thought of it myself.

28,★★★½,"Definitely the least Nolan that Nolan has ever Nolaned; I dug it! Worth watching for Pacino & Williams alone, otherwise a fairly standard crime thriller with a psychological edge & focus on character that I appreciated, plus some twisty turny stuff that was unpredictable & kept me engaged. Editing has its moments but kinda sucked throughout, & the end felt a little too neatly wrapped up.

The location makes for an interesting change of scenery to these sorts of films, every is overly bright and gives it a unique atmosphere.

It does raise my belief that Nolan is a far better director than a writer though, he brings a certain professionalism and competency behind the camera to this thriller that raises it a cut above. He should make more movies set in the pacific northwest, a region with a naturally cold and foggy atmosphere suits him well, I feel as if this is by far his best looking movie.",3,0.025,0.741,0.234,0.968

It really doesn't stick out from the crowd, and at points, the glacial pacing gets to be a tad annoying.
