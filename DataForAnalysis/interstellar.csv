22,★★★★★,"obviously, all clashing with nolan's cold precision and construction that attempts to turn scientific theory and very basic existential and emotional ideas of generational mortality into something not just physically tangible but physically achievable. ultimately makes this kind of feel like watching a weird, sad robot man try to algorithmically process the value of humans as deeply frail and emotional beings, which is dramatically misguided maybe but so conceptually moving i can't help but get swept up in it. i feel every corny second of this thing.",5,0.093,0.779,0.128,0.3427
