304,★★★★½,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" is not only the greatest superhero film ever made, but also one of the 2000's best movies. Heath Ledger's amazing turn as the Joker is unforgettable, and the film's themes of insanity, anarchy, heroism and politics make it entertaining, thrilling, scary, and surprisingly relevant to today's current events. Who would have thought?",4,0.132,0.538,0.329,0.9596
305,★★★★★,The second part of the trilogy is the best in the series with its fantastic action scenes & brilliant performances including the late Heath Ledger as The Joker who steals the movie with his unhinged nut job running rings around gotham & Batman.

The film also manages to strike the perfect balance between real-world grittiness and comic book fun which was a notable flaw in its predecessor. While this film does so many things right, it's Ledger's Joker who absolutely dominates this film with all of his odd ticks, memorable lines and nefarious activities and is THE reason to watch this movie.",5,0.065,0.764,0.171,0.924
