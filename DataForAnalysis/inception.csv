0,★★★★★,"""Inception,"" at its most basic, is two things. It is a heist film dressed in science fiction conventions; and it is a study of a man trying to free himself from a near-suffocating past. ""Inception,"" at its more complex, is a cerebral pop-masterpiece. It is an enthralling combination of thought-provoking, layered story-telling and sumptuous aesthetics enhanced by near-flawless editing, sound design, effects, and musical score. Driven by a pitch-perfect cast and the confident directorial hand of Christopher Nolan, ""Inception"" is a brilliant and unrivaled piece of filmmaking.",5.0,0.0,0.849,0.151,0.926
