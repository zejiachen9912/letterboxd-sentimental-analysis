16,★★★★★,"unfurls an intelligent and well-scripted narrative with the employment of some delusional composites of recollection and truth. The remorse and misconceptions of Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) are slowly illustrated, through the careful writing and direction of Christopher Nolan, into an excavation into an intriguingly questionable narration that gazes into a chasm of insanity and addiction, but which continues to be a compelling mystery long after the exposure of its necessary disclosures. This early Nolan triumph of misdirection moves miles beyond a conventional narrative hook to develop a classic noir of reverse chronology.",5.0,0.057,0.825,0.118,0.714
