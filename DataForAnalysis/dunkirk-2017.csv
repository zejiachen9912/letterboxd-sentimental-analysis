And it's also the one film that feels the least Nolan-like. The Hans Zimmer score is intense as hell. And the dogfight scenes with the spitfire planes are absolutely exhilarating and breathtaking.

Nolan does an incredible job of making a war movie without any blood, we never see a German, and dialogue is at a minimum. Instead, cinematography and color are magical.
