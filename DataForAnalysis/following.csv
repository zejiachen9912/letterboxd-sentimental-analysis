Sure it's low budget, but it's pretty awesome. The performances are great and the writing in this movie takes it to a different level. The music was awesome too.

262,★★★★,"Quite possibly my favorite Nolan film. This film speaks of vision over just about everything, the black and white, use of natural lighting, non-linear progressive plot. With just a tight low budget, Nolan really had to meticulously harness his craft to allow his story to be the told way he intended. Haw is charming yet dark, and Theobald plays perfect as Cobb's counterpart. This film just speaks volumes as Nolan from a directing standpoint. Following laid the groundwork for Nolan's storytelling and shows he's capable of more than just big budgets and sets.",4,0.02,0.775,0.206,0.9563

402,★★★★,"a few times and it continues to be one of the strong examples of what insane restrictions, a shoestring budget and a singular voice behind the camera can produce. It's not perfect, but it is an excellent showcase of the early signs of Christopher Nolan's talent that would later be perfected.",4,0.062,0.68,0.258,0.9337

404,★★★★½,"I now have full faith in Tenet. In terms of debut movies this stacks up as one of the most impressive I've seen, capturing the trademark twists and turns of a Nolan movie with the same efficacy as his later blockbuster movies, with only a $6,000 budget. You would think that a first time director would confuse his audience by playing with non-linear timelines but here its tightly written, fresh and original. This is a cool glimpse into where Nolan got started and its also interesting to see him do a smaller scale movie, both in story and in budget.",4,0.014,0.795,0.191,0.9516

412,★★★½,"I honestly wasn't expecting much from Nolan's first film. Usually, like Bong's Barking Dog, it takes a bit for a director to find its flare. However, this proves just how good Nolan is from his first scene. Following is able to create a very intriguing story with really not a ton going on, and some really solid performances that honestly felt a bit like Memento Lite. There are a lot of technical issues, which is to be expected, but overall the story was really fun for such a short movie.",3,0.0,0.81,0.19,0.9237
413,★★★½,"budget (friends & family appear as actors and their homes are used as key locations). Non-linear structure, cross-cutting, inserts, the rug-pulling, it's all here.
