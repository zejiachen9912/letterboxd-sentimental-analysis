Bale and Jackman deliver some of the best performances in their entire repertoires, while the tale is absolutely fascinating, with the rival magicians both being sympathetic at points and reprehensible at others. Pfister's cinematography is gorgeous and Smith's editing allows the endeavor to have the punch it needs.

96,★★★★★,"Magic as a metaphor for Filmmaking in the spoiler-centric modern era. Cinema is based on artful deception and illusion. But what if we all know the illusion is a fraud? The sequential nature of cinema forces audiences to read information along with the onscreen characters (The Prestige tells a story about liars should also lie to the audience.
